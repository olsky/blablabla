# Task: Environmental Data Monetization EPICs

**Session ID**: 2026-02-22_18-30-00  
**Date**: February 22, 2026  
**Agent**: EpicGenerator  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5  
**Provider**: Anthropic

## Objective

Generate 5 sophisticated, non-trivial EPIC ideas focused on **environmental data monetization** with 15-minute precision city data as the core asset.

## Requirements

### Business Constraints
- **Minimum first-year revenue**: $100,000,000 USD
- **Target**: Multi-billion dollar enterprise pain points
- **Market**: Industries with large capital, underserved by IT
- **Sales model**: Minimal sales involvement (API-first, self-service)
- **Adoption**: Easy integration, viral potential ("Wow, this was missing!")
- **Legal/Ethical**: 100% compliant, transparent, ethical

### Technical Constraints
- **Implementation timeline**: Maximum 3 months with AI/coding agents
- **Delivery model**: Pure software/microservice (no physical products)
- **Automation**: Zero human interaction required for core operations
- **Starting point**: Startup from zero (not enterprise scale)

### Feasibility Criteria
- **Technical feasibility**: Can be built with existing APIs, data sources, AI/ML tools
- **Business feasibility**: Realistic customer acquisition, pricing, and revenue model
- **ROI metrics**: Clear time-to-revenue and cash-out projections

## Core Data Asset

**15-Minute Precision City Environmental Data** including:
- Air quality (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, CO2, VOCs)
- Temperature and humidity (microclimate precision)
- Noise levels (dB across frequency bands)
- Pollen and allergen counts (species-specific)
- UV index and solar radiation
- Precipitation and stormwater accumulation
- Wind speed and direction

**Coverage**: Multiple cities, street-level granularity, 96 data points per day per sensor type.

## Scope

Generate 5 distinct EPIC ideas that:
1. Monetize environmental data through API/marketplace models
2. Target different verticals (real estate, insurance, healthcare, energy, compliance)
3. Solve quantifiable pain points with clear ROI for customers
4. Avoid duplication with existing EPICs (carbon credits, agricultural trading, hedge funds)
5. Demonstrate hyperscale revenue potential ($100M+ year 1)

## Deliverables

- 5 EPIC files (EP-0880 through EP-0884)
- Each EPIC includes: title, description, business case, feasibility score, risk analysis
- Session documentation: task.md, walkthrough.md, implementation_plan.md
