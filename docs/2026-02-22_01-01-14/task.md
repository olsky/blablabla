# EPIC Generation Session: Big Tech Data Monetization
## Session: 2026-02-22_01-01-14

### Context
Generate 5 new EPICs focused on **data selling to Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta** that meet strict viability criteria for a startup launching from zero.

### Primary Objective
Create sophisticated, non-trivial EPIC ideas for systems that:
- Generate positive cashflow through data monetization to Big Tech companies
- Can be implemented purely through AI/coding agents (no human interaction)
- Are microservices or systems (not physical products)
- Address real, quantifiable multi-billion dollar enterprise pain points

### Hard Requirements

#### Revenue & Business
- **Minimum first-year revenue**: $100,000,000 USD
- Minimal sales involvement (API-driven, self-service preferred)
- Rapid user growth potential
- Easy adoption ("WOW! That was really missing" factor)
- Hyper-scale revenue model

#### Technical & Timeline
- **Maximum implementation timeline**: 3 months
- Pure AI/Agent work (no human operational involvement)
- Microservice or system architecture
- Legal and ethical data collection/monetization
- Feasibility on BOTH technical AND business dimensions

#### Market Strategy
- Target fields where IT services are not yet present (or minimally present)
- Scan huge industries/markets with lots of capital
- Focus: ONE sector, drill deep
- Find niche sectors with killer-app potential
- Leverage abundant data sources

#### Startup Reality Constraints
- From zero, no enterprise resources
- Bootstrap-viable architecture
- Realistic 3-month agent-driven build
- No lurky/gray-area business models

### Sector Focus
**Data selling to Big Tech (Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta)**

These companies need:
- AI training datasets
- Product development insights
- User behavior understanding
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research data
- Feature prioritization signals
- Voice/NLP training data
- Cross-device behavior patterns
- Enterprise buying signals
- Developer ecosystem intelligence

### Required EPIC Components
Each EPIC must include:
1. **Idea Description**: The concept, why it's "WOW", what problem it solves
2. **ROI Analysis**: Time In vs Cash Out
3. **First Year Projections**: Revenue, user/client count
4. **Feasibility Score**: 0-10 rating
5. **Risk Analysis**: High/Medium/Low categorized risks
6. **Business Case**: Detailed financial model
7. **Technical Approach**: High-level architecture (AI/agent-driven)

### Success Criteria
- Non-banal, sophisticated ideas
- Unique and non-trivial solutions
- Real killer-app potential
- Quantifiable pain point addressed
- Legal and ethical compliance
- No duplicates of existing EPICs (scan project/epics/)
- Each EPIC validated against schemas/epic.schema.json

### Deliverables
1. `task.md` - This requirements document
2. `walkthrough.md` - Strategic analysis, ideation process, market research
3. `EP-0905.yaml` through `EP-0909.yaml` - Five validated EPICs
4. `implementation_plan.md` - Execution roadmap
5. `summary.md` - Portfolio summary and recommendations

### Topic Deep Dive: Big Tech Data Needs

#### Apple
- Siri/voice assistant improvement data
- App Store optimization signals
- Enterprise iOS deployment patterns
- Developer ecosystem health metrics
- Privacy-preserving ML training data

#### Google
- Search intent and failure analysis
- Android ecosystem behavior
- Cloud/GCP adoption drivers
- YouTube content performance predictors
- Enterprise workspace collaboration patterns

#### Amazon
- E-commerce pricing elasticity
- AWS service adoption signals
- Alexa interaction improvements
- Prime Video content demand forecasting
- B2B procurement intent data

#### Meta
- Cross-platform attribution data
- VR/AR interaction patterns
- Business messaging intent signals
- Ad creative performance predictors
- Developer platform adoption metrics

### Guiding Principles
1. **Sophistication First**: Avoid obvious, simple ideas
2. **Niche Power**: Find underserved micro-markets within huge industries
3. **Data Abundance**: Leverage existing data exhaust, make it valuable
4. **Network Effects**: Design for viral/organic growth where possible
5. **Ethical Foundation**: Clear consent, anonymization, GDPR/CCPA compliance
6. **API-First**: Self-service data access for Big Tech buyers
7. **Quality Over Quantity**: Premium, unique datasets command premium prices

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Physical products or hardware
❌ Human-in-the-loop operations
❌ Generic datasets (commoditized)
❌ Competitive with Big Tech (they'll build it themselves)
❌ Privacy violations or gray-area data collection
❌ Long sales cycles (no enterprise BD reliance)
❌ Regulatory heavy-lift (HIPAA, financial services, etc.)
❌ Ideas requiring >3 months to first revenue

### Session Timeline
- **Strategic Analysis**: 30 minutes (market research, ideation)
- **EPIC Creation**: 90 minutes (5 EPICs with full detail)
- **Validation**: 15 minutes (schema validation, quality check)
- **Documentation**: 30 minutes (implementation plan, summary)

**Total Session**: ~3 hours of deep work
