# Walkthrough: Media & Entertainment Sector (EP-0240 to EP-0249)

## Sector Rationale
The $2.5T media landscape is a complex web of intellectual property rights, fragmented distribution channels, and rapidly changing consumer behavior. The shift to digital streaming and programmatic advertising has created a data-rich environment where autonomous agents can excel. These 10 concepts are designed for rapid, sub-3-month development by AI agents, focusing on API-driven models to automate complex processes and create new revenue streams.

## The 10 EPIC Concepts

### EP-0240: Autonomous Music Royalty "Black Box" Recovery Service
**Concept:** Billions in music royalties go unclaimed each year, ending up in a "black box." This service autonomously ingests massive datasets from streaming platforms and performance rights organizations (PROs), using sophisticated audio fingerprinting and metadata matching to find and claim these lost royalties for artists and publishers.
**Revenue Model:** 15% contingency fee on all recovered royalties.

### EP-0241: Autonomous Programmatic Ad-Spend & "Brand Safety" Violation Clawback Engine
**Concept:** An engine that plugs into a brand's ad-tech stack. It continuously monitors where programmatic ads are being placed. If an ad appears on a site that violates the brand's safety guidelines (e.g., hate speech, fake news), it automatically files a clawback request with the ad exchange to recover the wasted spend.
**Revenue Model:** 20% contingency fee on all clawed-back ad spend.

### EP-0242: Autonomous Film & TV "Residuals" Calculation & Payout Network
**Concept:** Calculating and paying residuals (a form of royalty) to actors, writers, and directors is a notoriously complex manual process. This network automates it. It ingests distribution data from streamers and studios, applies the complex guild rules (SAG-AFTRA, WGA, DGA), and autonomously pays out the correct residual amounts.
**Revenue Model:** 2% transaction fee on all residuals processed.

### EP-0243: Autonomous "Dynamic Content" Personalization & Assembly Engine
**Concept:** A real-time video personalization engine. It takes a master video file and a library of alternative scenes, product placements, or dialogue. Based on the viewer's profile (e.g., location, viewing history, language), it autonomously assembles and serves a unique version of the content, personalized for them in real-time.
**Revenue Model:** Per-stream personalization fee paid by the content provider.

### EP-0244: Autonomous "Deepfake" & Copyright Infringement Detection-and-Takedown Service
**Concept:** A service that continuously scans social media platforms (YouTube, TikTok, etc.) for unauthorized use of a client's copyrighted video/audio or the appearance of deepfakes of their executives or talent. When a violation is found, it autonomously issues a DMCA takedown notice.
**Revenue Model:** Monthly subscription fee per client.

### EP-0245: Autonomous Influencer Marketing "Audience Authenticity" & ROI Scoring
**Concept:** Before a brand hires a social media influencer, this service autonomously analyzes the influencer's followers to detect bots, fake accounts, and engagement pods. It then provides a "True Audience" score and predicts the likely ROI of a campaign, preventing brands from wasting money on fake reach.
**Revenue Model:** Per-report fee for each influencer analysis.

### EP-0246: Autonomous Podcast Ad "Dynamic Insertion" & Real-Time Bidding Exchange
**Concept:** An ad exchange for podcasts. It allows advertisers to bid in real-time to insert their ads into a podcast's ad slots, even for the back catalog. The system dynamically stitches the winning ad into the audio file at the moment of download, tailored to the listener's location and demographics.
**Revenue Model:** 15% of ad revenue transacted through the exchange.

### EP-0247: Autonomous E-sports & Video Game "Clip" Licensing Marketplace
**Concept:** A marketplace where gamers can autonomously monetize their best gameplay clips. The system automatically ingests streams from Twitch and YouTube, identifies highlight-worthy moments using AI, and allows media companies or other creators to license the clips for their own content, with revenue shared back to the original gamer.
**Revenue Model:** 30% commission on all licensing fees.

### EP-0248: Autonomous "Localization" & Cultural Compliance Engine for Global Film Release
**Concept:** An AI that scans a film or TV show's script and video, flagging potential cultural issues (e.g., offensive gestures, inappropriate humor, religious insensitivity) for different international markets. It suggests edits, alternative dialogue, or scenes to ensure the content is suitable for a global audience.
**Revenue Model:** Per-project analysis fee.

### EP-0249: Autonomous Streaming Video "Quality of Experience" (QoE) & Churn Predictor
**Concept:** A service for streaming platforms (like Netflix or Disney+) that ingests client-side video player data (buffering events, resolution switches, etc.). It uses this data to predict which individual subscribers are having a poor viewing experience and are at high risk of churning, allowing the platform to proactively intervene.
**Revenue Model:** Per-subscriber, per-month monitoring fee.
