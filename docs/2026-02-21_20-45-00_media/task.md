# Task: Generate EPICs for Media & Entertainment Sector (EP-0240 to EP-0249)

## Objective
Generate a batch of 10 highly sophisticated, autonomous software business concepts (EPICs) targeting the **Global Media & Entertainment Sector**. The goal is to create systems that generate massive positive cash flow (minimum $100M in the first year) with zero human interaction, focusing on software/data solutions that can be developed by AI agents within 3 months.

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Sector Focus:** Media & Entertainment (Content Licensing, Royalty Management, Ad-Tech, Audience Analytics).
- **Revenue Floor:** Minimum $100,000,000 in Year 1.
- **Nature:** 100% software/autonomous agents. No physical products.
- **Automation:** Zero human interaction. Fully autonomous execution via APIs, data ingestion, and algorithmic decision-making.
- **Sophistication:** Non-banal, highly complex, unique "killer apps".
- **Development Timeframe:** Each concept must be viable for development by autonomous AI agents within a maximum of 3 months.
- **Scale:** Hyper-scale potential, rapid user growth, easy adoption (API-first).
- **Sales:** Minimal sales involvement (self-serve, API integration, or contingency-based value extraction).
- **Format:** Adhere strictly to the `epic.schema.json` format.
- **Numbering:** Start from EP-0240 and end at EP-0249.
- **Uniqueness:** Must not duplicate any existing EPICs in the corpus.

## Rationale for Sector Selection
The $2.5 trillion media and entertainment industry is characterized by complex licensing agreements, fragmented royalty streams, and a constant battle for audience attention. Autonomous agents can create significant value by automating the tracking and settlement of royalties, optimizing ad-spend in real-time, and generating novel insights from audience data. The shift to streaming and digital content creates a purely digital environment where these agents can operate with maximum efficiency.

## Deliverables
1. `task.md` (This document)
2. `walkthrough.md` (Detailed breakdown of the 10 concepts)
3. `implementation_plan.md` (Execution strategy)
4. 10 YAML files (`EP-0240.yaml` through `EP-0249.yaml`) in `project/epics/`
5. Validation of all generated files against the schema.
