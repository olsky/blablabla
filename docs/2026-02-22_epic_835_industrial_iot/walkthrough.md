# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 835-Series (Industrial IOT & Manufacturing)

## Overview
Successfully generated **15 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0835 through EP-0849)** focusing on **Industrial IOT & Predictive Manufacturing Infrastructure**.

The sector was chosen for its high capital concentration ($50B annual downtime cost) and the massive efficiency gap between modern AI and legacy factory floors.

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_835_industrial_iot`.
2. Developed and executed `generate_803_manufacturing_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
3. Verified 15 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics
- **EP-0835 (Zero-Downtime Maintenance Oracle):** Predicting failure via acoustic/vibration sensors and autonomously summoning repair-techs before the line stops.
- **EP-0836 (Manufacturing-as-a-Service Clearinghouse):** Creating a liquid global market for idle CNC and 3D printing capacity.
- **EP-0839 (Industrial Energy-Surcharge Recovery Bot):** Recovers millions in overpaid utility surcharges via autonomous PUC protests.
- **EP-0842 (SKU-Level Carbon Passport Ledger):** Automating the multi-trillion dollar lifecycle carbon accounting mandated by upcoming EU/US regulations.
- **EP-0849 (Industrial Water-Rights Arbitrage Engine):** High-frequency trading and algorithmic diversion of water rights for semiconductor fabs.

All 15 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
