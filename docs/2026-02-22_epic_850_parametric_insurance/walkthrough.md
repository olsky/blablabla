# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 850-Series (Parametric & Re-insurance Arbitrage)

## Overview
Successfully generated **15 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0850 through EP-0864)** focusing on **Parametric Insurance & Re-insurance Arbitrage**.

The sector was chosen for its extreme scale ($6 Trillion global premium volume) and the massive inefficiency of legacy claims adjusting and underwriting processes.

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_850_parametric_insurance`.
2. Developed and executed `generate_804_insurance_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
3. Verified 15 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics
- **EP-0850 (Parametric Hurricane Oracle):** Real-time satellite-driven payouts for storms, eliminating claims adjusters and 15% admin overhead.
- **EP-0853 (Wildfire-Risk Dynamic Underwriting):** Daily-priced insurance for homes in high-risk zones based on soil moisture and satellite telemetry.
- **EP-0854 (Autonomous Ransomware Negotiator):** Algorithmic hostage negotiation and decryption verification for cyber-claim settlement.
- **EP-0856 (Automatic Flight-Delay Payout Bot):** Passively recovers millions in EU261-style compensation for travelers via global radar APIs.
- **EP-0861 (Generative Subrogation-as-an-API):** Recovers billions in overpaid claims from other insurers via automated legal clawback-bots.

All 15 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
