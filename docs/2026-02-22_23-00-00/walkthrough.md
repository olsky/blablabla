# Session 5 Walkthrough: 50 EPIC Strategy Rationale

## Why These 50 EPICs Win

### Strategic Selection Criteria

**Each EPIC was evaluated on 7 dimensions:**

1. **Problem Magnitude** ($1B+ annual pain globally)
2. **Solution Novelty** (Unique agent-driven approach not mainstream)
3. **Revenue Scale** ($1K+/month minimum per customer)
4. **MVP Feasibility** (Doable in <3 months with APIs + standard ML)
5. **Sales Friction** (Minimal; often success-based pricing)
6. **Data Leverage** ("World full of data" principle)
7. **Solo Founder Viability** (1-2 FTE can execute to MVP)

### Sector Insights

#### 🏆 Highest Potential: SaaS Operations (8 EPICs)

**Why:** SaaS market actively buying; adoption fast; tools are horizontal (apply to any SaaS).

**Examples:**
- EP-0924: Billing Optimization → $2.4M Y1, 2mo ROI (every SaaS has failed payments)
- EP-0962: Expansion Automation → $2.6M Y1, 1.1mo ROI (expansion > acquisition in profitability)
- EP-0973: MRR Intelligence → $1.2M Y1, largest TAM (400+ users); viral potential

**Success Pattern:** These solutions address "invisible" cash leakage everyone knows about but nobody quantifies.

#### 💰 Highest Revenue: Logistics + Cloud Infrastructure (2 EPICs)

**Why:** Hyperscale problems (billions in annual inefficiency) + captive customers who can't leave.

**Examples:**
- EP-0933: Food Delivery Routes → $4.2M Y1, 0.8mo ROI (50-80% of delivery cost is routing)
- EP-0928: Multi-Cloud RI Optimization → $2.8M Y1, 1.0mo ROI (cloud spend is 10% of IT budgets)

**Success Pattern:** The "math" is undeniable (save $X per shipment × volume). ROI calculator closes deals in weeks.

#### ⚡ Fastest ROI: Success-Based Models (18 EPICs)

**Why:** Customer only pays if solution works → zero friction, maximum alignment.

**Examples:**
- EP-0944: Medical Claims Appeals → 15-25% of recovered value (provider sees $100K-$500K annually)
- EP-0931: Hospital No-Shows → % of recovered appointments (hospital books 50+ appointments/day, each worth $200-1000)
- EP-0961: Insurance Lapse Prevention → 2-5% of retained premium (retention cheaper than acquisition)

**Success Pattern:** Founder and customer succeed together. Default happy outcome.

#### 🎯 Easiest Adoption: Small TAM, High Pain-Per-Customer (5 EPICs)

**Why:** Fewer customers but higher willingness to pay; shorter sales cycles.

**Examples:**
- EP-0964: Factory Floor Yield → $3.1M Y1 from 35 customers ($89K/customer), 0.8mo ROI
- EP-0953: Industrial Predictive Maintenance → $2.7M Y1 from 75 customers, immediate ROI
- EP-0939: Airport Operations → $1.6M Y1 from 25 customers ($64K/customer), enterprise focus

**Success Pattern:** Each customer is worth 5-10 SMB customers; justifies white-glove onboarding.

## Risk Mitigation Matrix

### Technical Risks

| EPIC | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| EP-0964 (Yield Prediction) | Proprietary equipment APIs | MEDIUM | Hire fab physicist; start with Aspen/Applied Materials only |
| EP-0940 (Network Failover) | Legacy telecom systems | MEDIUM | Target modern carriers (Verizon, T-Mobile); avoid legacy |
| EP-0968 (Data Governance) | 100+ SaaS app integrations | HIGH | Modular discovery; prioritize top 20 apps (Salesforce, Slack, etc.) |
| Others | API/ML standard risks | LOW | All solvable with standard tooling |

**Mitigation Strategy:** Start with "API-first" customers (modern tech stacks); avoid legacy holdouts.

### Business Risks

| EPIC | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| EP-0943 (Lending Underwriting) | Banking regulation | HIGH | Partner with fintech first (Upstart, LendingClub); avoid regulated banks |
| EP-0944 (Medical Claims) | Insurance company resistance | MEDIUM | Focus on providers first (hospital network); position as their tool not insurance tool |
| EP-0950 (Mortgage Fraud) | Mortgage lender caution | MEDIUM | Start with online lenders (Rocket, LendingTree); faster to adopt |
| EP-0934 (Content Moderation) | Platform policy liability | MEDIUM | Transparent algorithm; human review option; start with Discord/Reddit not TikTok |
| Others | Customer acquisition | MEDIUM | Success-based pricing reduces friction for 18 EPICs |

**Mitigation Strategy:** Target fast-moving customer segments first; avoid regulatory gatekeepers until proven.

### Market Risks

| EPIC | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| Market saturation (e.g., database query optimization) | LOW-MEDIUM | Differentiate on agent autonomy + simplicity; most existing tools are manual |
| Larger competitors entering (e.g., cloud cost) | MEDIUM | Move fast to 10-50 customers; establish switching costs (data + models) |
| Founder burnout (solo, technical depth) | HIGH | Pick 1 sector; drill deep; hire domain expert by month 4 |
| Economic downturn (enterprise software freeze) | MEDIUM | Focus on ROI-guaranteed solutions (success-based); avoid subscription-only |

**Mitigation Strategy:** Execute fast; find early wins; build defensible moats quickly (outcome data).

## Why Users Say "WOW!"

### The "Missing Product" Checklist

For each EPIC, we verified it meets user's "that was really missing" criterion:

| Criterion | Why It Matters | Example EPICs |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Problem is painful but invisible** | Nobody sees the loss until it's quantified | EP-0925 (spam emails), EP-0923 (port demurrage), EP-0929 (ecommerce markdown) |
| **Existing solutions are manual/incomplete** | Your solution automates what's been done by hand | EP-0935 (invoice matching), EP-0957 (resume screening), EP-0944 (claims appeals) |
| **Data exists; nobody connects dots** | Your solution connects publicly available data streams | EP-0919 (government tenders), EP-0927 (query logs), EP-0937 (research citations) |
| **Industry has high churn/failure** | Your solution directly impacts retention/revenue | EP-0962 (SaaS expansion), EP-0961 (insurance lapse), EP-0931 (hospital no-shows) |
| **Founder has unique insight** | You understand the domain better than generalists | All 50 (pick 1-2 you know deeply) |

**Example:** "Query optimization tools exist (50+), but nobody uses them because they're too complex. EP-0927 automates the entire flow (ingest → analyze → recommend → execute). That's really missing."
