title: Automated API Contract Drift Detection Service (B2B DevOps SaaS)
description: |
  **Idea:** In microservice architectures, API contracts (the agreed-upon shape of requests and responses between services) drift silently as teams evolve independently. This produces runtime breakages that only surface in production. This system hooks into CI pipelines as a GitHub App. On every PR, it automatically extracts the inferred OpenAPI/GraphQL schema from the new code changes using static analysis, compares it against the published contract registry, calculates a semantic diff (distinguishing additive/non-breaking from destructive/breaking changes), and blocks the merge if a breaking change is introduced without an explicit version bump and downstream consumer notification.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 weeks. Multi-language AST-to-schema inference is the hard technical part (Python/Go/TS/Java). GitHubApp integration is well-documented.
  - Cash Out: Per-seat engineering organization subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Engineering Organizations: 30
  - Estimated Earnings: $180,000 ($500/mo average per org)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Schema inference tools like Pydantic and OpenAPI generators already exist per language; the integration layer is the main engineering investment.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Low Risk: Purely defensive developer tooling.
  - Adoption Risk: Developers resist tools that block their PRs. Onboarding UX and false-positive rate on the "breaking" classification are critical to adoption.
