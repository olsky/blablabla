title: Parametric Micro-Insurance Trigger Engine for SMBs
description: |
  **Idea:** Traditional claims-based insurance is expensive, slow, and adversarial. Parametric insurance pays out automatically when a measurable real-world trigger event occurs — no claims adjuster, no dispute. This system creates, sells, and executes parametric micro-insurance products for SMBs using public data streams as oracles: NOAA weather APIs (frost event for a restaurant's outdoor event), USGS earthquake sensors, national grid status APIs (power outage for a cold-storage business). When a trigger fires, the smart contract or payment rail executes the payout immediately — zero human processing.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~12 weeks. The core engineering is the trigger oracle pipeline and a bulletproof payout state machine. Requires obtaining a surplus-lines insurance license or white-labeling through an existing licensed carrier.
  - Cash Out: Monthly premiums minus reinsurance and payout costs.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Active SMB Policy Holders: 300
  - Estimated Gross Premiums: $180,000
  - Net Earnings after reinsurance/payouts: $45,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 5/10 (Technical architecture is clear, but obtaining or white-labeling an insurance license creates a significant regulatory and capital barrier.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High Regulatory Risk: Operating as an insurer without a license is illegal. Partnership with a licensed fronting carrier is mandatory and adds complexity and cost.
  - Correlated Event Risk: A single major weather event could trigger thousands of payouts simultaneously, requiring robust reinsurance.
