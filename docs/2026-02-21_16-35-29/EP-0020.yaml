title: Autonomous SaaS Pricing Intelligence & Elasticity Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** SaaS companies almost universally under-price or over-price their products, leaving enormous revenue on the table. This system connects to a client's billing platform (Stripe, Chargebee). It autonomously instruments usage telemetry (feature X was used N times per session, cohort Y churned after hitting plan limit Z). An LLM and pricing econometrics model analyzes willingness-to-pay signals embedded in usage patterns. The system then autonomously runs micro-experiments — presenting price test variants to new signup cohorts via Stripe Checkout customization API — and generates a statistically rigorous optimal pricing recommendation within 90 days, with projected annual revenue lift quantified in dollars.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 weeks to build the Stripe instrumentation layer, the behavioral econometrics models, and the automated A/B price experiment orchestrator.
  - Cash Out: Retainer + success fee on the documented revenue lift created.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Active SaaS Clients: 25
  - Average Revenue Lift Created per Client: $80,000/yr
  - Estimated Earnings (15% success fee + $2k/mo retainer): $330,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10 (All underlying Stripe APIs and behavioral analytics infrastructure are mature. Pricing econometrics is an established field.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Low Risk: A/B pricing tests are standard commercial practice and legal in all jurisdictions as long as discounts are applied equally to comparable cohorts.
  - Commercial Risk: If the system recommends a price increase that accelerates churn, the success fee model protects the client but destroys the case study.
