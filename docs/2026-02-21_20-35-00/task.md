# Task: Generate EPICs for Global Insurance & Reinsurance Sector (EP-0200 to EP-0209)

## Objective
Generate a batch of 10 highly sophisticated, autonomous software business concepts (EPICs) targeting the **Global Insurance & Reinsurance** sector. The goal is to create systems that generate massive positive cash flow (minimum $100M in the first year) with zero human interaction, focusing purely on software/data solutions that can be developed by AI agents within 3 months.

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Sector Focus:** Global Insurance & Reinsurance (Underwriting, Claims, Parametric, Capital Management).
- **Revenue Floor:** Minimum $100,000,000 in Year 1.
- **Nature:** 100% software/autonomous agents. No physical products.
- **Automation:** Zero human interaction. Fully autonomous execution via APIs, data ingestion, and algorithmic decision-making.
- **Sophistication:** Non-banal, highly complex, unique "killer apps".
- **Development Timeframe:** Each concept must be viable for development by autonomous AI agents within a maximum of 3 months.
- **Scale:** Hyper-scale potential, rapid user growth, easy adoption (API-first).
- **Sales:** Minimal sales involvement (self-serve, API integration, or contingency-based value extraction).
- **Format:** Adhere strictly to the `epic.schema.json` format.
- **Numbering:** Start from EP-0200 and end at EP-0209.
- **Uniqueness:** Must not duplicate any existing EPICs in the corpus.

## Rationale for Sector Selection
The insurance and reinsurance industry, valued at over $6 trillion, is one of the largest pools of capital in the world. It operates on legacy systems, manual processes (underwriting, claims), and statistical models that are slow to adapt to new data sources. This creates a massive opportunity for autonomous software agents to introduce hyper-efficiency, new product categories, and data-driven risk models. By leveraging real-time data streams (satellite, IoT, financial markets), AI agents can underwrite, price, and settle claims with a speed and accuracy that is impossible for human-centric organizations, unlocking billions in value.

## Deliverables
1. `task.md` (This document)
2. `walkthrough.md` (Detailed breakdown of the 10 concepts)
3. `implementation_plan.md` (Execution strategy)
4. 10 YAML files (`EP-0200.yaml` through `EP-0209.yaml`) in `project/epics/`
5. Validation of all generated files against the schema.
