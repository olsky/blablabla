# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 880-Series (RegTech & Sovereign Compliance)

## Overview
Successfully generated **20 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0880 through EP-0899)** focusing on **Autonomous Sovereign Compliance & Global RegTech**.

The sector was chosen for its mandatory adoption curves ($1B+ fines for non-compliance) and the explosion of complex global regulations (AI Act, CBAM, Sanctions) that humans cannot monitor at scale.

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_880_regtech_sovereign_compliance`.
2. Developed and executed `generate_806_regtech_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
3. Verified 20 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics
- **EP-0880 (Sanctions-Evasion Detection Oracle):** Satellite and social-graph AI that exposes the 'Dark Fleet' the humans miss.
- **EP-0881 (TBML Invoice Scrubber):** Multi-modal LLMs that identify money laundering via trade mis-invoicing at a global SKU-price level.
- **EP-0887 (Algorithmic-Ethics Audit-as-a-Service):** An AI that 'audits other AIs' to generate legally-mandated ethics certifications for the EU AI Act.
- **EP-0892 (Privacy-Preserving ZK Compliance):** A Zero-Knowledge network that allows banks to find common criminals without sharing private data.
- **EP-0899 (Algorithmic Transparency Ledger):** Providing ZK-proofs of AI decision-logic for regulatory flight-recording.

All 20 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
