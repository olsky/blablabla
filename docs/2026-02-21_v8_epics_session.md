# V8 EPIC Session — 2026-02-21

## Session Goal
Generate 10 new, non-banal, hyper-scale, autonomous cashflow EPICs with minimum $1M first-year earnings. No duplication of prior 40 EPICs.

## Methodology
1. Scanned EP-0001–EP-0040 to avoid overlap.
2. Targeted sectors with massive unrealized data leverage: healthcare, legal, security, e-commerce, finance, insurance.
3. Prioritized: easy adoption (API/plugin installs), massive markets, clear ROI to buyer.
