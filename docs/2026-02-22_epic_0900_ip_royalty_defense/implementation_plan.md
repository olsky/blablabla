# Implementation Plan: Autonomous Intellectual Property & Royalty Defense

## Sector Intelligence: The "Invisible Asset" Crisis
Intellectual Property is the foundation of the modern economy, yet auditing its use is 90% manual and reactive. Billions are lost annually to "Accidental Infringement"—companies using code, samples, or designs without knowing they are proprietary.

## Strategic Selection: High-Alpha Discovery (Cash Cows)
We are avoiding banal "Patent Filing" software. Instead, we are building **"Enforcement Oracles"** that find value and deliver a "Checkmate" demand.

### Themes:
1. **Algorithmic Kernel Defense:** Finding proprietary code snippets inside compiled binary or public repos.
2. **Sub-second Media Fingerprinting:** Identifying micro-samples (3-5 seconds) in global streaming firehoses.
3. **Generative AI "Style" Attribution:** Monetizing the "Style-DNA" of artists inside LLM/Image models.
4. **Supply-Chain Design Scrubber:** Using Computer Vision to find structural design-patent infringement in e-commerce SKUs.
5. **Sovereign Patent Arbitrage:** Moving IP ownership to optimize for the strongest legal protection or lowest tax burden minute-by-minute.

## Feasibility Guardrails
- **Discovery Logic:** Using agentic NLP (for contracts) and Computer Vision (for physical designs).
- **Legality:** All systems work within established Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and USPTO frameworks.
- **Monetization:** Primarily contingency-based (30% of recovered royalties) or "Micro-Licensing" fees ($10/event).
- **Sales:** Zero-sales approach—the service sends a "Proof of Infringement" and a "Pay now to License" link.
