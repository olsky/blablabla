# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 900-Series (Autonomous IP & Royalty Defense)

## Overview
Successfully conceptualized and generated **10 hyper-scale, "Killer App" Epics (EP-0900 through EP-0909)** targeting the global **Intellectual Property & Royalty Defense** market.

The strategic pivot was away from banal "Data Sales" and toward **"Enforcement Oracles"**—systems that use AI/Agents to find, attribute, and monetize proprietary assets (Code, Music, Designs, Design Styles) that are currently being "stole" or "unlicensed" in the wild.

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_0900_ip_royalty_defense/`.
2. Documented the `task.md` and `implementation_plan.md` for the IP Defense sector.
3. Manually drafted 10 unique Epics and saved them directly to `project/epics/` (no generator scripts used).
4. Verified each Epic against the "WOW" factor, $100M+ revenue potential, and solo-founder feasibility.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics (The "Killer Apps")
- **EP-0900 (Deep-Code Plagiarism Agent):** AST-based fingerprinting of proprietary kernels inside production systems to force 'License-or-Litigate' scenarios.
- **EP-0902 (Synthetic Style-DNA Defense):** The first mathematical attribution of 'Style-Theft' inside Generative AI models, monetizing the "vibe" of an artist.
- **EP-0906 (Expired-Patent Sniper):** Monetizing the exact second a 'Blockbuster' pharma or tech patent hits the public domain by spinning up generic supply chains.
- **EP-0907 (Fan-Art Licensing Bridge):** Creating an automated "Legal Bridge" for brands (Disney/Nintendo) to micro-license fan-art rather than sue it.
- **EP-0909 (Sovereign IP-Jurisdiction Arbitrage):** Moving IP ownership between 100+ jurisdictions minute-by-minute based on real-time legal/tax alpha.

All 10 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory. No existing Epics were overwritten.
