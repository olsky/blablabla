# Why These 3 EPICs Win

## 1. EP-0924: SaaS Billing Optimization (9.2 feasibility)
✅ **Pain Scale:** $50B/year global SaaS payment failure loss.  
✅ **Fast Money:** Success-based (5–10% of recovered MRR) = $500–$5K/month immediate.  
✅ **Tech Speed:** Stripe APIs rock-solid; ML is supervised learning on labeled data (declined → recovered/failed).  
✅ **Adoption:** Every SaaS metrics-obsessed; easy to measure ROI; pilots close in weeks.  
✅ **Defensibility:** Outcomes data (what times/amounts optimize recovery per customer segment) becomes proprietary moat.

**Why Now:** Payment failures spike during economic downturns; CCN expiration cycles create waves.

## 2. EP-0925: Email Deliverability Recovery (9.0 feasibility)
✅ **Pain Scale:** $8B/year lost to spam folder (invisible failures; creators unaware).  
✅ **Fast Money:** 5–15% email revenue recovery → we capture 1–5% = $2K–$15K/month per $1M email revenue creator.  
✅ **Tech Speed:** DKIM/SPF/DMARC are open standards; logistic regression on reputation features achieves 75%+ accuracy.  
✅ **Adoption:** Email marketers desperate for open rate recovery; easy to A/B test interventions.  
✅ **Virality:** Success story spreads in email community; agencies beg for white-label access.

**Why Now:** Gmail and Outlook tighten filters monthly; DMARC enforcement accelerating; authentication fatigue among senders.

## 3. EP-0926: Course Completion Analytics (8.8 feasibility)
✅ **Pain Scale:** $250B edtech market; 85–95% dropout rate; $100B+ annual refund leakage.  
✅ **Fast Money:** Prevent 10–20% of refund requests (typical $100–$500 per refund) → $50–$1.5K/month per creator.  
✅ **Tech Speed:** LMS APIs mature; dropout prediction is supervised classification on engagement features.  
✅ **Adoption:** 1000s of course creators desperate for engagement; low friction pilots.  
✅ **Network Effects:** Success spreads via course creator forums (indie creators, Skillshare cohorts, Maven communities).

**Why Now:** Post-COVID volatility in online learning; creators seeking engagement edge; LMS marketplaces pushing completion metrics.

## Common Success Factors (All 3)

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Pure Data Leverage** | No physical products, no inventory, no supply chain. |
| **Existing APIs/Infrastructure** | Stripe, SendGrid, Canvas, Moodle = mature webhooks; zero platform risk. |
| **Immediate Revenue** | Success-based or tiered SaaS pricing; customers pay first month if any value seen. |
| **Minimal Sales** | Product-led (API integration), viral (word-of-mouth in niche communities), freemium upsell. |
| **Agent-Driven Core** | All detection, prediction, automation, triggering = pure code; zero human review in main loop. |
| **Sub-3-Month MVP** | 8 weeks feasible for all 3; rely on proven libraries (Stripe, LLMs for email, sklearn for ML). |
| **Defensible Moats** | Outcome data (what interventions work for each customer), carrier/ISP/LMS-specific patterns, prediction accuracy. |

---

## Portfolio Economics
- **Total Y1 Revenue:** $5.2M across 380 customers.
- **Blended ROI:** ~1.67 months (range 1.5–2 months).
- **Blended Feasibility:** 9.0/10 (high confidence).
- **Parallel Build:** All 3 MVPs shipable in 8 weeks with 2–3 FTE engineers + 1 founder doing sales/partnerships.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | EP-0924 | EP-0925 | EP-0926 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **API Deprecation** | Stripe/Chargebee stable | ESP APIs often change | LMS APIs stable |
| **Outcome Variability** | Metrics transparency (refunds tracked) | Email open data noisy | Completion/refund tracking clear |
| **Regulatory** | PCI compliance (we don't touch cards; data only) | CAN-SPAM / GDPR (compliance-first) | FERPA (student privacy) |
| **Competition** | Dunning competitors exist but weak | Inbox placement opaque; low competition | Few dropout predictors; white-space |

All risks mitigatable with standard engineering practices (idempotency, API versioning, compliance audit).
