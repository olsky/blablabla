# Task: Untapped Sector EPIC Generation (Sophisticated, Solo Founder AI-Agent Model)

## Session Context
**Date:** February 22, 2026, 01:21 UTC  
**Session ID:** 2026-02-22_01-21-34  
**Prior Sessions:** 
- Big Tech Data Monetization (5 EPICs: EP-0900–EP-0904, $648M potential)
- Monetization Speed Reviews (10 EPICs analyzed, fastest: EP-0737 at 1-month ROI)

## User Requirements (Exact Specification)

### Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Solo Founder + AI Agents Only** – No human sales teams, no customer support staff; all operations autonomous or minimal manual handoff
2. **3-Month Maximum Build Timeline** – MVP to revenue in 12 weeks
3. **No Physical Products** – Pure software/data/automation/services
4. **No Human Interaction Required** – API-first, fully autonomous execution path
5. **Multi-Billion Dollar Pain Points** – Target sectors with >$10B annual addressable market friction
6. **Legal & Ethical Only** – No gray zones; must withstand regulatory scrutiny
7. **Leverage Existing Data/Ideas** – Don't create new scientific breakthroughs; aggregate and apply existing knowledge
8. **Sophisticated & Non-Trivial** – Architecture must be complex enough to resist competition; not "just a chatbot"

### Narrative Constraint
**"World is full of data/ideas/money – just need to take it."**  
Translation: Identify existing assets (data, processes, inefficiencies) that are misallocated, fragmented, or trapped in legacy systems. Build autonomous extraction + redistribution layers.

### Sector Strategy
**Avoid:** Customs, construction permits, clinical trials, legal discovery, insurance underwriting, patent/IP enforcement, estate planning (all saturated with 4–10+ existing EPICs)  
**Target:** Untapped sectors identified via comprehensive EPIC scan:
- Medical coding denial administration
- Import duty/tariff optimization (non-customs)
- Published research data monetization
- Government RFP automation at scale
- Supply chain ESG/sustainability compliance

## Generation Targets

### 5 New EPICs (EP-0905 through EP-0909)
Each must include:
- **Epic ID & Title:** Compelling, descriptive
- **First-Year Revenue:** $95M–$210M (Big Tech reference: EP-0902 = $130M)
- **Feasibility Score:** 7.0–9.5 (realistic for solo founder in 12 weeks)
- **ROI Timeline:** 2–4 months (faster than Big Tech batch average of 2.6 months)
- **Risk Analysis:** Technical, market, legal, operational
- **Automation Score:** 8.0+ (pure autonomy, <10% human touch)
- **Hidden Insight:** Non-obvious but data-driven competitive advantage

### Supporting Documentation
1. **walkthrough.md** – Strategic analysis of why these 5 sectors are underserved + why NOW is the inflection point
2. **implementation_plan.md** – 12-week detailed roadmap (modules, data sources, agent architecture, Phase 1→3 milestones)
3. **summary.md** – Portfolio overview, competitive positioning, total TAM coverage, monetization velocity comparison vs prior 40-reviewed EPICs

## Success Criteria

✓ 5 EPICs pass schema validation (100%)  
✓ Each EPIC describes plausible 3-month MVP path  
✓ Total first-year revenue >$500M (portfolio level)  
✓ Average feasibility >8.0 (high solo-founder viability)  
✓ Average ROI <3 months (faster than prior batches)  
✓ Zero sector overlap with existing 904 EPICs  
✓ All legal/ethical checkboxes ticked  
✓ Complete session documentation (4 files, >10,000 words)

## Notes
- This session represents the THIRD major EPIC generation effort (Environmental Data → Big Tech Data → **Untapped Sectors**)
- Highest-priority EPIC discovery: Monetization speed (1-month ROI achievable in healthcare + import sectors)
- Unique positioning: These 5 sectors have <1% automation saturation in their real-world markets; solo founder advantage is MAXIMUM
