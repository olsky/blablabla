# Task: Generate Unicorn-Scale Autonomous Cashflow EPICs ($1B+ Y1)

**Session ID:** 2026-02-21_19-00-00  
**Created:** 2026-02-21  
**Agent:** planner (claude-opus-4)

## Objective

Generate 10 EPICs (EP-0130 through EP-0139) describing autonomous, software-based systems capable of generating **$1,000,000,000+ in Year 1 revenue** — true unicorn-scale opportunities.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| Minimum Y1 Earnings | US $1,000,000,000 |
| Delivery Model | Autonomous microservices / platforms |
| Physical Products | Prohibited |
| Human Interaction | Prohibited (all by coding agents) |
| Sales Involvement | Minimal (self-serve, viral, or embedded) |
| IT Presence in Sector | Prefer near-zero or absent |
| Legal/Ethical | Mandatory compliance |
| Uniqueness | No thematic overlap with 100 existing EPICs |
| Sophistication | Non-banal, non-trivial, hyper-scale |
| Starting EPIC ID | EP-0130 |
| Count | Minimum 10 EPICs |

## Scoring Criteria (from spec)

- Hyper-scale revenue → more points
- Rapid user growth → more points
- Easy adoption → more points
- "WOW! That was missing!" factor → more funding chances
- ROI data (time in vs cash out) → required
- Feasibility score → required
- Risk analysis → required
- First-year projections (earnings, users) → required

## Target Markets (identified via corpus analysis)

After scanning all 100 existing EPICs, the following massive markets were identified as having:
1. Near-zero IT sophistication
2. Trillions in annual transaction volume
3. Structural inefficiencies extractable as revenue
4. Regulatory barriers low enough for autonomous software

### Selected $1B+ Opportunities

| # | Market | Size | Gap | EPIC Focus |
|---|--------|------|-----|------------|
| 1 | Healthcare Claims Denial | $262B denied/yr US | Manual appeals | Auto-appeal & recovery |
| 2 | Payment Interchange | $100B+ in fees | Suboptimal routing | Dynamic rail optimization |
| 3 | Real Estate Closing | $50B+ in costs | Manual title search | Instant settlement |
| 4 | Pharma Rebates | $180B in rebates | 5-10% leakage | Leakage recovery |
| 5 | B2B Invoice Financing | $50T in invoices | Fragmented factoring | Instant dynamic factoring |
| 6 | Mortgage Origination | $40B+ in fees | Manual underwriting | Factory automation |
| 7 | Corporate Treasury | $100T+ in cash | Idle/suboptimal | Auto-allocation & sweep |
| 8 | Insurance Distribution | $1T+ in costs | Human brokers | Autonomous aggregation |
| 9 | Employer Health Plans | $4T US spend | 25% waste | Waste & duplicate recovery |
| 10 | Enterprise Tax Credits | $500B+ unclaimed | Manual discovery | Auto-capture engine |

## Deliverables

1. ✅ Session documentation (this task.md)
2. ⏳ Walkthrough (walkthrough.md)
3. ⏳ Implementation plan (implementation_plan.md)
4. ⏳ 10 EPIC YAML files (EP-0130 through EP-0139)
5. ⏳ Schema and integrity validation

## Success Criteria

- All 10 EPICs pass schema validation
- All 10 EPICs pass integrity validation
- Zero thematic overlap with existing 100 EPICs
- All 10 EPICs project $1B+ Y1 earnings
- All EPICs include ROI, feasibility score, risk analysis, and projections
