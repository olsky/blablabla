# Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
The objective is to formulate 10 sophisticated, non-banal, autonomous business Epic ideas (EP-0500 to EP-0509) capable of generating over $100M in the first year with a timeline of under 3 months for implementation. The epics will be stored as YAML files under `project/epics/` without human interaction required for their modeled execution.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run YAML validation on to ensure compliance with the repository's epic templating logic.

### Manual Verification
- User to review the 10 Epics to confirm none overlap with existing ones, and all meet the $100M, zero-human, and niche criteria.
