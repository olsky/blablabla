# Implementation Plan (EP-0110..EP-0119)

## Steps
1. Reconfirm uniqueness versus EP-0001..EP-0109 (buyer, data, action loop).
2. Draft 10 EPICs with mandatory business viability sections and $10M+ Y1 earnings.
3. Emphasize minimal sales effort (API/self-serve) and underserved sectors.
4. Save EPIC files with correct schema fields and review policy.
5. Validate with schema/integrity scripts after creation.

## Scoring Rubric
- **Feasibility (1-10):** data availability, integration difficulty, regulatory friction.
- **ROI:** time to MVP vs projected cash generation model.
- **Risk:** categorized High/Medium with mitigations.
- **Projections:** base-case users/customers and earnings year 1 (>= $10M).

## Acceptance
- 10 EPICs added (EP-0110..EP-0119), schema-valid, unique vs corpus, legal/ethical, autonomous ops, no physical product.
