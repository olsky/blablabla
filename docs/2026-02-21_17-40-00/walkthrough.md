# Walkthrough — EP-0110..EP-0119

## Actions
- Reviewed prior EPICs up to EP-0109 to avoid overlap.
- Applied triple uniqueness (buyer, data, action) and $10M+ Y1 revenue floor.
- Authored 10 new EPICs for underserved, high-cashflow niches with autonomous operation and minimal sales friction.

## Notes
- No physical products; API/self-serve delivery preferred.
- All concepts include ROI, feasibility score, risk, and projections.
- Legal/ethical by design; no deceptive or non-compliant practices.

## Next (not executed here)
- Run review/aggregation agents.
- Decompose approved EPICs into user stories.
