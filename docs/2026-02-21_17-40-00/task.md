# EPIC Generation Session (Batch EP-0110+)

## Objective
- Generate **10 new, non-trivial EPICs** (EP-0110 through EP-0119) for autonomous, legal, ethical cashflow systems with >= US$10,000,000 year-one earnings projections.
- Focus on minimal sales involvement, easy adoption, and sectors historically underserved by IT automation.

## Constraints
- Avoid physical products; software/services only.
- Avoid human-in-the-loop operations; rely on coding agents and APIs.
- Uniqueness: no duplication of prior EPICs (EP-0001..EP-0109). Each must differ by buyer, data substrate, and autonomous action loop.
- Include per-EPIC: Idea, ROI (time-in vs cash-out), Feasibility Score, Risk Analysis, Year-1 users/customers, Year-1 earnings.

## Deliverables
- 10 EPIC files: `EP-0110.yaml` .. `EP-0119.yaml` in `project/epics/`.
- Session docs: `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md` in this folder.
