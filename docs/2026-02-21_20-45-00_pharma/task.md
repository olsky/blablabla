# Task: Generate EPICs for Pharma & Biotech Sector (EP-0220 to EP-0229)

## Objective
Generate a batch of 10 highly sophisticated, autonomous software business concepts (EPICs) targeting the **Global Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Sector**. The goal is to create systems that generate massive positive cash flow (minimum $100M in the first year) with zero human interaction, focusing on software/data solutions that can be developed by AI agents within 3 months.

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Sector Focus:** Pharma & Biotech (Drug Discovery, Clinical Trials, Supply Chain, Regulatory Compliance).
- **Revenue Floor:** Minimum $100,000,000 in Year 1.
- **Nature:** 100% software/autonomous agents. No physical products.
- **Automation:** Zero human interaction. Fully autonomous execution via APIs, data ingestion, and algorithmic decision-making.
- **Sophistication:** Non-banal, highly complex, unique "killer apps".
- **Development Timeframe:** Each concept must be viable for development by autonomous AI agents within a maximum of 3 months.
- **Scale:** Hyper-scale potential, rapid user growth, easy adoption (API-first).
- **Sales:** Minimal sales involvement (self-serve, API integration, or contingency-based value extraction).
- **Format:** Adhere strictly to the `epic.schema.json` format.
- **Numbering:** Start from EP-0220 and end at EP-0229.
- **Uniqueness:** Must not duplicate any existing EPICs in the corpus.

## Rationale for Sector Selection
The $1.5 trillion pharmaceutical industry is built on data, but much of it is siloed and underutilized. The process from drug discovery to market is incredibly long and expensive. AI agents can create immense value by autonomously analyzing preclinical data, optimizing clinical trial recruitment, tracking real-world evidence, and ensuring supply chain integrity. The 3-month development constraint favors API-driven models that can quickly deliver value by connecting disparate data sources.

## Deliverables
1. `task.md` (This document)
2. `walkthrough.md` (Detailed breakdown of the 10 concepts)
3. `implementation_plan.md` (Execution strategy)
4. 10 YAML files (`EP-0220.yaml` through `EP-0229.yaml`) in `project/epics/`
5. Validation of all generated files against the schema.
