# Walkthrough: Pharma & Biotech Sector (EP-0220 to EP-0229)

## Sector Rationale
The $1.5T pharmaceutical industry is an information-driven, high-stakes environment. Development cycles are long (10+ years) and expensive ($1B+ per drug), yet much of the data analysis relies on manual processes. This creates a perfect opportunity for autonomous agents to deliver immense value. These 10 concepts are designed for rapid, sub-3-month development by AI agents, focusing on API-first, data-centric models to solve critical industry problems.

## The 10 EPIC Concepts

### EP-0220: Autonomous Preclinical Data "Toxicity Hotspot" Predictor
**Concept:** An engine that autonomously ingests and analyzes thousands of public and private preclinical toxicology study results (e.g., from platforms like CDD Vault). It uses deep learning to identify novel molecular substructures that are highly correlated with adverse toxicological effects, allowing drug discovery companies to "fail faster" before spending millions on animal studies.
**Revenue Model:** Per-analysis fee ($10,000 per compound library scan).

### EP-0221: Autonomous Clinical Trial Patient Recruitment & Matching Engine
**Concept:** An autonomous agent that scans electronic health records (EHRs) from partner hospital networks and public trial registries (like ClinicalTrials.gov). It matches patients to complex clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria in real-time and programmatically contacts their physicians to suggest enrollment, drastically reducing recruitment time.
**Revenue Model:** $5,000 fee per successfully enrolled patient, paid by the pharma sponsor.

### EP-0222: Autonomous Real-World Evidence (RWE) & Off-Label Usage Detection
**Concept:** This system ingests anonymized claims data and EHRs to identify real-world usage patterns of approved drugs. It can detect potential new "off-label" indications for existing drugs, creating massive new revenue opportunities for pharma companies to pursue label expansion.
**Revenue Model:** $1M/year subscription plus a 1% success fee on peak sales of the new indication.

### EP-0223: Autonomous Pharmaceutical "Cold Chain" Integrity & Spoilage Insurance
**Concept:** A parametric insurance product for shipping sensitive biologics. The system ingests real-time IoT temperature data from shipments. If the temperature deviates from the specified range for a set duration, a smart contract automatically triggers a payout to the pharma company, eliminating claims paperwork.
**Revenue Model:** 10% premium margin.

### EP-0224: Autonomous Generic Drug "Patent Cliff" Arbitrage Oracle
**Concept:** An oracle that monitors pharmaceutical patent expiry dates and global regulatory filings. It predicts which generic drug will get first-to-file (FTF) status and its likely launch date. It then sells this high-value predictive data to hedge funds and generic drug manufacturers.
**Revenue Model:** $5M/year subscription for the data feed.

### EP-0225: Autonomous Clinical Trial "Data-Dredging" for Failed Studies
**Concept:** Pharma companies have vaults of data from failed clinical trials. This agent re-analyzes that data, looking for previously missed biomarker-defined subgroups of patients who *did* respond to the drug. This can rescue a failed drug and turn it into a successful niche therapeutic.
**Revenue Model:** 5% royalty on future sales of the rescued drug.

### EP-0226: Autonomous "Orphan Drug" Indication-Finding Engine
**Concept:** An AI that scans all known genetic databases and medical literature to find novel connections between rare diseases and existing drug compounds' mechanisms of action. It generates a ranked list of potential "orphan drug" designation opportunities for pharma companies to pursue.
**Revenue Model:** Per-report fee ($100,000) plus a success fee upon achieving orphan drug status.

### EP-0227: Autonomous Global Pharmaceutical Pricing & Reimbursement Database
**Concept:** A real-time database that autonomously scrapes and aggregates drug pricing and reimbursement decisions from every public health authority worldwide (e.g., NICE in the UK, CADTH in Canada). It provides a single source of truth for pharma pricing strategy teams.
**Revenue Model:** $500,000/year subscription.

### EP-0228: Autonomous Contract Research Organization (CRO) Performance & Quality Scoring
**Concept:** An engine that ingests data from clinical trials (e.g., data query rates, protocol deviations, timelines) to create a real-time performance score for different CROs. This allows pharma sponsors to select the highest-quality CROs and avoid costly trial delays.
**Revenue Model:** $250,000/year subscription for access to the scoring data.

### EP-0229: Autonomous Drug Counterfeiting Detection via Supply Chain Analysis
**Concept:** This system analyzes drug serialization data (as mandated by the DSCSA) across the entire supply chain. It uses anomaly detection to identify counterfeit drugs entering the legitimate supply chain by spotting impossible or illogical transaction patterns, saving lives and protecting brand revenue.
**Revenue Model:** Per-scan fee paid by manufacturers and distributors.
