# Implementation Plan: EPIC Batch EP-0700 to EP-0749

**Phases:**
1. **EPIC Ideation and Documentation (Current):** Generate and validate 50 EPICs in Autonomous EV Charging Infrastructure Management sector. Each EPIC includes business case, feasibility, risk analysis.
2. **User Story Decomposition:** Agents break down each EPIC into detailed user stories (US-XXXX.yaml) with acceptance criteria.
3. **Implementation Planning:** For each EPIC, create implementation plans with architecture, tech stack, and timelines (max 3 months).
4. **Code Generation and Validation:** AI agents generate code, run tests, and validate against schemas.
5. **Deployment and Monitoring:** Launch as SaaS, monitor adoption and revenue.

**Go-To-Market Strategy:**
- **Target Audience:** EV network operators, utilities, automakers, municipalities.
- **Pricing Model:** Freemium for small deployments, tiered subscriptions ($10K-$1M/year) based on network size.
- **Adoption Channels:** API integrations with Tesla, ChargePoint, etc.; partnerships with energy companies; direct SaaS signups.
- **Value Proposition:** "Autonomous optimization that saves 30% on costs and enables 2x faster expansion – zero human intervention."
- **Revenue Projections:** Aim for 10,000+ enterprise customers in year 1, $500M+ revenue through subscriptions and data licensing.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Start with pilot programs in high-growth regions (US, EU, China); ensure compliance with energy regulations.</content>
