# Walkthrough: Autonomous EV Charging Infrastructure Management

**Sector Thesis:** The global EV charging infrastructure is a $100B+ market projected to hit $500B by 2030, driven by massive data streams from millions of vehicles, grid sensors, weather APIs, and user patterns. Autonomous AI systems can unlock unprecedented efficiency: predicting demand to prevent blackouts, optimizing grid load for cost savings, automating maintenance to reduce downtime, and enabling frictionless adoption. This sector lacks sophisticated IT services, making it ripe for killer-apps that deliver "wow, that was missing" value through hyper-scale revenue (subscription models), rapid user growth (network effects), and zero-touch operation. Viability: Pure software, data-driven, buildable in 3 months by agents leveraging existing APIs and ML frameworks.

**Lanes:**
1. Demand Forecasting and Load Balancing
2. Predictive Maintenance and Fault Detection
3. Autonomous Billing and Settlement
4. Grid Integration and Renewable Energy Optimization
5. User Behavior Analytics and Personalization
6. Supply Chain and Inventory for Charging Hardware
7. Regulatory Compliance Automation
8. Cybersecurity and Threat Detection
9. Scalability and Multi-Region Orchestration
10. Integration with Smart Cities and IoT Ecosystems

Each EPIC drills a unique angle in this sector, ensuring non-trivial sophistication and niche focus.</content>
