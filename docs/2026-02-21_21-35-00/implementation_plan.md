# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- Build data graph from accounting, payment, bank, and commerce APIs.
- Stand up policy/risk engine and event-driven orchestration.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)
- Launch autonomous loops: detect -> decide -> execute -> reconcile.
- Add explainability and rollback-safe controls.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10)
- Activate self-serve onboarding + embedded partner integrations.
- Add dynamic pricing and revenue-share billing.

## Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12)
- Hardening, anti-fraud tuning, compliance packs, and corridor rollout.

## GTM
- API-first + app-store channels (accounting, payments, commerce ecosystems).
- Contingency/performance pricing to minimize upfront purchase friction.
