# Walkthrough

## One-man startup thesis
The fastest path to outsized revenue is embedding autonomous cashflow logic inside platforms where SMB transactions already occur (invoicing, payroll, procurement, marketplaces, logistics). No field sales-heavy enterprise motion is required if distribution rides API ecosystems and app marketplaces.

## Why this sector can hit $1B trajectory
- Massive fragmented SMB base globally.
- Existing rails: payments, bank APIs, accounting APIs, payroll APIs.
- Direct measurable ROI: fewer failed payments, better working capital, lower fraud/loss.
- Monetization loops: take-rate on volume, risk-spread, recovered-value contingency.
