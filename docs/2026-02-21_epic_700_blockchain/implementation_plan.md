# Generation of Epic 700-Series (Blockchain & AI)

The user has requested a new set of highly sophisticated Epics combining Pure AI/Agents and Blockchain. The explicit goal is a hyper-scale impact (min US$100,000,000 revenue in Year 1) achievable by a solo founder ("1 man startup"). The user stressed "take just one sector, drill it", avoiding generic catch-all platforms, and focusing on unique, missing-in-the-market ("killer app") B2B or specialized financial infrastructure.

## Proposed Ideation Pillars (Niche Sectors)
1.  **DeFi Threat Extrication (MEV Rescue):** AI Front-running hackers to secure TVL.
2.  **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) Arbitrage:** Liquid routing of GPU/Bandwidth.
3.  **RWA (Real World Asset) Fractional Yield Sweeping:** Automating micro-yields across physical assets.
4.  **Zero-Knowledge Compliance Oracles:** Cryptographic B2B identity for institutional capital.
5.  **Cross-Chain Algorithmic Insurance:** Parametric stablecoin & protocol hacking insurance.

All Epics will follow the required YAML structure, detailing exact ROI, First Year Projections, Feasibility Scores, and deep Risk Analysis.

## Epic Scope
We will generate 15 Epics (EP-0700 through EP-0714) using an automated Python dictionary script to guarantee identical formatting while allowing for massive textual depth in the `Description` matrix.

## Verification
- Confirm all output is pure software/code (no physical delivery).
- Ensure no human intervention is structurally necessary in the business model.
- Confirm Blockchain/Crypto primitives (Smart Contracts, ZK-proofs, Oracles, Tokenization) are central to the mechanism.
