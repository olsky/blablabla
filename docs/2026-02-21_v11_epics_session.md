# V11 "Unicorn" EPIC Session — 2026-02-21

## Session Goal
Generate 10 highly sophisticated, non-banal, autonomous "Unicorn" EPICs crossing the $1,000,000,000 ($1B+) first-year revenue threshold.
Target massive global capital pools and industries completely untouched by modern autonomous IT services (infrastructure finance, global treasury, reinsurance, pharma data).

## Methodology
To hit $1B+ in Y1 revenue without a physical product and without human interaction, the autonomous systems must:
1. Manage/arbitrage gigantic existing capital flows (e.g., global payroll float, CRE leases, FX swaps).
2. Take a small percentage fee (0.1% to 15%) on massive volume (Hundreds of billions in structured principal or settled royalties).
3. Bypass traditional, highly-paid human intermediaries (Investment bankers, Big 4 accountants, reinsurance underwriters, patent litigators).

## V11 EPICs Created (EP-0150 to EP-0159)

## Validation
- All 10 new EPICs successfully passed JSON Schema (`epic.schema.json`) validation natively.

## Recommended Next Actions
- **EP-0156 (Corporate Treasury FX Router)** and **EP-0159 (Supply Chain Escrow)** present the highest feasibility-to-reward ratios. They rely on existing banking/IoT API rails and solve massive operational nightmares for global enterprises, generating $1.5B+ annually.
