# Task: Counterfeiting Detection Epics Generation (1100‑1109)

## Objective
Generate a batch of **10 hyper‑scale, autonomous “Boring Work‑Horse” Epics** (EP‑1100 – EP‑1109) focused on **counterfeiting detection** across high‑value industries. Each Epic must:
- Produce positive cash‑flow via automated detection and remediation.
- Be a pure software/micro‑service solution (no physical product).
- Require zero human interaction after deployment (AI agents handle the entire workflow).
- Target a real, quantifiable enterprise pain‑point worth billions of dollars.
- Be feasible for a solo founder to build in ≤ 3 months.
- Include ROI, feasibility score, risk analysis, and first‑year projections.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 10 unique EPIC YAML files created in `project/epics/` (EP‑1100‑EP‑1109).
- [ ] Task, implementation plan, and walkthrough documents stored under `docs/2026-02-22_epic_1100_counterfeiting_detection/`.
- [ ] No overlap with existing EPICs (checked up to EP‑0999).
