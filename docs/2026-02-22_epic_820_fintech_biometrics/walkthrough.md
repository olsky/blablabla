# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 820-Series (Biometric & Behavioral FinTech)

## Overview
Successfully generated **15 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0820 through EP-0834)** focusing on **Biometric, Behavioral, and Institutional FinTech Infrastructure**.

The sector was chosen for its massive $100B+ fraud prevention and wealth-transfer opportunities, perfect for a "1-man startup" using autonomous, sub-second AI monitoring and API execution.

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_820_fintech_biometrics`.
2. Developed and executed `generate_802_fintech_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
3. Verified 15 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics
- **EP-0820 (Elderly Financial Abuse Guardian):** Behavioral AI that freezes transactions based on typing cadence and sentiment, protecting $1.2B in vulnerable wealth.
- **EP-0823 (Generative Proof-of-Life Escrow):** An immortal 'Dead-Man's Switch' for $50B in digital inheritance without a human lawyer.
- **EP-0824 (Institutional 'Watchmen' Multi-sig):** A behavioral veto agent for billion-dollar treasury transfers to prevent coordinated human compromise.
- **EP-0830 (Autonomous SaaS 'Zombie' Killer):** An automatic budget-cutting agent that finds and cancels millions in unused enterprise software seats via SSO analysis.
- **EP-0833 (Autonomous Digital Estate Executor):** Algorithmic settlement of global estates in 24 hours via government-verified death certificates and smart contracts.

All 15 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
