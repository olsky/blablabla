# Walkthrough

## Sector thesis
Trade finance and commodity movement run on fragmented docs, slow settlement, and high leakage (fees, disputes, fraud, penalties). This is ideal for autonomous software because value sits in data reconciliation, risk scoring, pricing, and event-driven execution.

## Why startup-feasible in <=3 months
- API-first surfaces already exist: AIS vessel data, customs filings, sanctions lists, freight events, banking rails, cloud OCR, insurer/reinsurer APIs.
- First wedge can be one workflow and one monetization loop (contingency, per-transaction fee, or spread share).
- Land-and-expand motion: start with one route/corridor, then scale globally.
