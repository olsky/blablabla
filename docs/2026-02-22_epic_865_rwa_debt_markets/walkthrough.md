# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 865-Series (RWA & Debt Markets)

## Overview
Successfully generated **15 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0865 through EP-0879)** focusing on **Real World Assets (RWA) & Debt Markets**.

The sector was chosen for its high capital intensity and the massive liquidity gaps in illiquid debt markets (Music, Aircraft, Patents, SaaS Revenue-Based-Finance).

## Work Completed
1. Created session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_865_rwa_debt_markets`.
2. Developed and executed `generate_805_rwa_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
3. Verified 15 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics
- **EP-0865 (Individual Patent Royalty Market):** Algorithmic discovery and licensing of 'accidental' patent infringement for inventors.
- **EP-0868 (Venture Debt for SaaS Marketing):** Automated high-speed capital for SaaS ad-spend cycles based on live unit-economics.
- **EP-0872 (Autonomous Default Repossession Bot):** Algorithmic shutdown of physical assets (ships, jets) upon loan default.
- **EP-0873 (Secondary Market for SaaS Contracts):** Tokenizing future enterprise software revenue to provide instant capex for founders.
- **EP-0876 (Dividend-Capture Arbitrage Engine):** High-frequency yield extraction across global stock and tokenized dividend ledgers.

All 15 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
