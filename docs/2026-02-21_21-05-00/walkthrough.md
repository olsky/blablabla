# Walkthrough

## Sector thesis
AI demand has turned power availability, cooling efficiency, and capacity allocation into the main economic bottlenecks for data centers. Most value is trapped in scheduling, pricing, outage risk, utility contracts, and workload placement decisions.

## Why this is startup-feasible in <=3 months
- Existing telemetry + market data APIs (BMS/DCIM, utility tariffs, weather, workload orchestration)
- Software-only control loops (recommend/execute/settle)
- Fast wedge monetization: savings-share, congestion pricing, risk-premium optimization

## Idea lanes for 30 EPICs
1. Power and tariff arbitrage
2. Cooling and thermal optimization
3. Capacity marketplace and commitments
4. SLA and outage risk pricing
5. Carbon-aware workload and settlement
6. Hardware failure and maintenance economics
7. Interconnect and egress optimization
8. Financial hedging for energy volatility
9. Insurance-like parametric protections
10. Revenue management for colo + GPU capacity
