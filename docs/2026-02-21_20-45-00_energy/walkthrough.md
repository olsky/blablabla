# Walkthrough: Energy & Utilities Sector (EP-0230 to EP-0239)

## Sector Rationale
The multi-trillion dollar energy industry is defined by massive capital assets, complex physical networks, and volatile commodity markets. The transition to renewable, intermittent power sources (wind, solar) and the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) like batteries and EVs are creating unprecedented challenges for grid stability and asset management. This data-rich environment is perfect for autonomous agents to optimize, trade, and manage risk with superhuman speed and efficiency. These 10 concepts are designed for rapid, sub-3-month development by AI agents.

## The 10 EPIC Concepts

### EP-0230: Autonomous Wind Turbine Predictive Failure & Performance Degradation Engine
**Concept:** An AI that ingests high-frequency SCADA data (vibrations, temperatures, blade pitch) from wind turbines. It predicts gearbox failures, blade icing, and other performance-degrading events weeks in advance, allowing operators to schedule maintenance and avoid costly downtime.
**Revenue Model:** $1,000 per turbine per year subscription.

### EP-0231: Autonomous Solar Farm "Soiling" Detection & Optimal Cleaning Scheduler
**Concept:** This system analyzes satellite imagery and on-site production data to detect when dust and dirt ("soiling") are reducing a solar farm's output. It then calculates the optimal time to dispatch cleaning crews by balancing the cost of cleaning against the lost revenue, maximizing asset profitability.
**Revenue Model:** 20% of the incremental revenue gained from optimized cleaning schedules.

### EP-0232: Autonomous Natural Gas Pipeline "Pigging" Anomaly Detection Service
**Concept:** "Pigs" are instrumented devices that travel through pipelines to inspect them. This service autonomously ingests the terabytes of sensor data from a pig run, using machine learning to automatically identify and classify potential defects (like corrosion or cracks) far more accurately than human analysts.
**Revenue Model:** $100 per mile of pipeline analyzed.

### EP-0233: Autonomous Energy Grid "Congestion" & Arbitrage Trading Bot
**Concept:** An algorithmic trading bot that monitors real-time electricity prices at different nodes on the power grid. It identifies "congestion" where power is cheap on one side of a transmission constraint and expensive on the other, then automatically buys and sells financial transmission rights (FTRs) to profit from the spread.
**Revenue Model:** 15% of trading profits.

### EP-0234: Autonomous Substation Vegetation Management & Wildfire Risk Oracle
**Concept:** An oracle that uses satellite and drone imagery to monitor vegetation growth around electrical substations and transmission lines. It automatically identifies encroachment that poses a wildfire or outage risk and dispatches drone-based trimming services or ground crews.
**Revenue Model:** Per-asset monitoring fee paid by utilities.

### EP-0235: Autonomous Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Creation & Marketplace
**Concept:** A platform that automatically ingests generation data from solar and wind farms, mints the corresponding RECs on a blockchain, and sells them on an open marketplace to corporations seeking to meet their sustainability goals. This automates a slow, manual, and opaque process.
**Revenue Model:** 5% transaction fee on all RECs sold.

### EP-0236: Autonomous LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) Cargo "Boil-Off" Arbitrage Engine
**Concept:** LNG tankers constantly lose a small amount of cargo to evaporation ("boil-off"). This algorithmic engine analyzes global LNG prices, shipping routes, and weather forecasts to calculate the most profitable voyage. It might advise a ship to speed up (using boil-off as fuel) or slow down to sell the gas at a higher price at its destination.
**Revenue Model:** 20% of the arbitrage profit generated per voyage.

### EP-0237: Autonomous Power Plant Outage & "Generation-Following" Insurance
**Concept:** A parametric insurance product for grid operators. The system monitors real-time power plant output. If a major plant unexpectedly trips offline, the policy automatically pays out to the grid operator to cover the high cost of purchasing last-minute replacement power.
**Revenue Model:** 10% premium margin.

### EP-0238: Autonomous Residential Smart Meter "Data Disaggregation" Service
**Concept:** An API that ingests smart meter data from a home and uses AI to "disaggregate" the total energy usage into individual appliance signatures (e.g., "your HVAC is running," "your EV is charging"). This data is highly valuable to appliance manufacturers, repair services, and utilities.
**Revenue Model:** Data-as-a-Service subscription fee.

### EP-0239: Autonomous Hydro-Dam Water Flow & Power Generation Optimization Engine
**Concept:** An AI that creates an optimal daily and weekly power generation schedule for hydroelectric dams. It ingests weather forecasts (to predict inflows), electricity price forecasts, and environmental regulations (e.g., minimum water release levels), to maximize revenue while meeting compliance.
**Revenue Model:** 10% of the incremental revenue generated vs. a baseline schedule.
