# Implementation Plan (EPIC Ideation Session)

## Planned Work
1. Scan existing EPIC inventory and avoid conceptual overlap.
2. Generate 12 sophisticated EU-first concepts with high adoption potential.
3. Enforce legal/ethical boundaries and autonomous-operation constraints.
4. Encode each EPIC with required business viability sections.
5. Validate repository schema/integrity after creation.

## Data/Scoring Model (Base Case)
- **ROI (Time In):** estimated months to MVP + first monetizable release.
- **ROI (Cash Out):** subscription + usage + performance/recovery fee mix.
- **Feasibility Score (1-10):** weighted estimate of data availability, integration complexity, regulatory friction, and GTM difficulty.
- **Risk Analysis:** categorized into High/Medium with concrete mitigations.
- **Year-1 Projections:** users/customers + estimated earnings (USD).

## Acceptance Criteria
- 12 new EPICs are added with sequential IDs.
- Each EPIC has >= $1M projected first-year earnings.
- Each EPIC is non-duplicate using buyer/data/action uniqueness.
- Each EPIC remains legal and ethical.
