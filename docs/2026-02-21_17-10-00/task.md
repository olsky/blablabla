# EPIC Generation Session (EU-First Cashflow Systems)

## Objective
- Generate **12 new, non-trivial EPICs** focused on legal and ethical software/services that can produce positive cashflow.
- Scope is ideation only (no user stories decomposition, no implementation/code planning beyond session artifacts).

## Constraints Applied
- Market assumption: **EU-first**.
- Delivery mode: autonomous software/microservice systems (no physical product dependency).
- Operations: minimize/avoid human interaction in core workflow via coding agents and API integrations.
- Quality: non-banal and differentiated from prior EPICs.
- Financial threshold: each EPIC must project **>= US$1,000,000** in first-year earnings (base case).
- Required analysis in each EPIC: idea, ROI (time-in/cash-out), feasibility score, risk analysis, first-year users and earnings.

## Uniqueness Rule
Strict triple uniqueness against existing EPIC corpus:
1. Distinct primary buyer persona.
2. Distinct primary data source set.
3. Distinct autonomous action loop.

## Deliverables
- New EPIC files: `EP-0051.yaml` through `EP-0062.yaml` in `project/epics/`.
- This session folder with:
  - `task.md`
  - `implementation_plan.md`
  - `walkthrough.md`
