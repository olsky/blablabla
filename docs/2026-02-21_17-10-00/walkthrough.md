# Walkthrough — 12 New EPIC Generation

## What Was Done
- Existing EPIC landscape (`EP-0001`..`EP-0050`) was reviewed to avoid repeated sectors and mechanisms.
- A strict uniqueness filter was applied per concept:
  - unique buyer,
  - unique data substrate,
  - unique autonomous execution loop.
- 12 new EPICs were created for EU-first monetization paths with rapid adoption potential.

## Why These Concepts
- Favor sectors where fragmented data + expensive manual reconciliation creates immediate willingness to pay.
- Favor API-connectable workflows enabling autonomous operation by agents.
- Favor pricing models with strong cashflow dynamics (recovery-fee, transaction-fee, high-retention SaaS).

## Governance Notes
- No physical-product-first concepts were used.
- No illicit, deceptive, or unethical business models were used.
- All concepts are framed for legal operation with compliance mitigations in risk sections.

## Next Stage (Not Executed Here)
- Run review agents.
- Aggregate review outcomes.
- Decompose approved EPICs into user stories.
- Then proceed to implementation planning.
