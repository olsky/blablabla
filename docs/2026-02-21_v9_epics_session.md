# V9 EPIC Session — 2026-02-21

## Session Goal
Generate 10 new, non-banal, hyper-scale autonomous cashflow EPICs. 
Requirement: Minimum $1M first-year earnings. Numbering starts at EP-0100 to leave space for prior expansions.

## Methodology
1. Scanned prior 50 EPICs to ensure zero duplication.
2. Focused on massive B2B/Fintech pain points where the automation of a complex data flow unlocks instant liquidity, recovers lost revenue, or eliminates expensive human brokers.
3. Prioritized: B2B collections, customs brokerage, programmatic media buying, gig-worker liquidity, and code tech-debt.

## Validation
- All 10 new EPICs pass JSON Schema (`epic.schema.json`) validation natively.

## Recommended Next Actions
- EP-0100 (Chargebacks) and EP-0109 (Wage Factoring) have the highest near-term ROI feasibility due to excellent API ecosystems (Stripe/Plaid) and immediate, tangible financial pain points.
