# Task: Generate EPICs for Global Semiconductor Manufacturing & Supply Chain (EP-0190 to EP-0199)

## Objective
Generate a batch of 10 highly sophisticated, autonomous software business concepts (EPICs) targeting the **Global Semiconductor Manufacturing & Supply Chain** sector. The goal is to create systems that generate massive positive cash flow (minimum $100M in the first year) with zero human interaction, focusing purely on software/data solutions.

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Sector Focus:** Global Semiconductor Manufacturing & Supply Chain (Fabs, Yield, Equipment, IP, Packaging).
- **Revenue Floor:** Minimum $100,000,000 in Year 1.
- **Nature:** 100% software/autonomous agents. No physical products.
- **Automation:** Zero human interaction. Fully autonomous execution via APIs, telemetry ingestion (SECS/GEM), and algorithmic decision-making.
- **Sophistication:** Non-banal, highly complex, unique "killer apps".
- **Scale:** Hyper-scale potential, rapid user growth, easy adoption (API-first).
- **Sales:** Minimal sales involvement (self-serve, API integration, or contingency-based value extraction).
- **Format:** Adhere strictly to the `epic.schema.json` format.
- **Numbering:** Start from EP-0190 and end at EP-0199.
- **Uniqueness:** Must not duplicate any existing EPICs in the corpus.

## Rationale for Sector Selection
The semiconductor industry is a $600B+ market characterized by massive capital expenditure, extreme complexity, and razor-thin margins on yield. A modern fab costs $20B to build and generates terabytes of telemetry data daily. Even a 0.1% improvement in yield, equipment uptime, or supply chain routing translates to tens of millions of dollars in pure profit per fab. Currently, much of this optimization relies on legacy enterprise software and human engineers. Autonomous software agents that can ingest SECS/GEM equipment data, EDA (Electronic Design Automation) logs, and global supply chain signals to automatically optimize operations, arbitrage resources, and predict failures represent a massive, untapped opportunity for high-margin, contingency-based SaaS.

## Deliverables
1. `task.md` (This document)
2. `walkthrough.md` (Detailed breakdown of the 10 concepts)
3. `implementation_plan.md` (Execution strategy)
4. 10 YAML files (`EP-0190.yaml` through `EP-0199.yaml`) in `project/epics/`
5. Validation of all generated files against the schema.
