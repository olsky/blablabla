# Walkthrough (Why this EPIC)
- Pain magnitude: $35B+/year demurrage/detention/storage fees; 5–15% erroneous/avoidable.
- Gap: SMB importers lack unified automation; existing tools serve enterprise TMS with high integration cost.
- Data leverage: Carrier/terminal APIs, EDI events, ACE/ICS feeds, trucking GPS—no new data collection needed.
- Fast ROI: Success-based disputes can generate $1K–$10K/month savings within 60 days.
- Adoption ease: Email/API only; no on-site installs; works alongside any TMS or spreadsheets.
- Defensibility: Evidence packet templates + carrier-specific dispute playbooks improve over time; outcomes data is proprietary.
- Why now: Port congestion volatility keeps fee risk high; carriers pressured to honor documented disputes.
