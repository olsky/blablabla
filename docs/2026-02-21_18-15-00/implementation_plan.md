# Implementation Plan — Hyper-Scale EPICs (EP-0120..EP-0129)

## Design Rationale
To hit the $100M Y1 floor, only three business-model archetypes qualify:
1. **Recovery-fee on found money** — unclaimed assets, royalties, overcharges. Customer already owes nothing; you deliver cash and take a cut. Zero sales friction, massive viral potential.
2. **Transaction-fee on enormous volume** — matching/marketplace on multi-trillion-dollar flows (containers, pension secondaries, court data). Small % × huge GMV.
3. **Prevention-value on catastrophic loss** — food recalls, wildfire, identity theft. Buyer pays eagerly because downside is existential.

## Scoring Rubric
- **Feasibility (1-10):** data availability × integration complexity × regulatory friction × technical risk.
- **ROI:** months-to-MVP vs. projected cash generation cadence.
- **Risk:** categorized High / Medium / Low, each with a concrete mitigation.
- **Projections:** base-case users/customers and earnings year 1 (>= $100M, defensible with stated assumptions).

## Acceptance Criteria
- 10 EPICs added, schema-valid, unique vs. entire corpus.
- Each projects >= $100M Y1 with transparent assumption chain.
- No domain overlap with existing 85 EPICs.
- All legal, ethical, autonomous, no physical products.
