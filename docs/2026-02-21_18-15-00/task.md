# EPIC Generation Session — Hyper-Scale Batch (EP-0120+)

## Objective
Generate **10 new, hyper-scale EPICs** (EP-0120 through EP-0129) for autonomous, legal, ethical cashflow systems with **>= US$100,000,000** year-one earnings projections.

## Hard Constraints
- Minimum Y1 revenue floor: **$100,000,000**.
- Minimal sales involvement — self-serve / API / viral adoption paths.
- Prefer fields where IT services were **not present** (or barely present) until now.
- Each must be genuinely "high-profile" — not an incremental improvement on existing tools.
- Zero overlap with existing 85 EPICs (EP-0001..EP-0119).
- No physical products; software/services only.
- No human-in-the-loop core operations.
- All legal and ethical.

## Uniqueness Gate
Strict triple uniqueness vs. full corpus:
1. Distinct primary buyer persona.
2. Distinct primary data substrate.
3. Distinct autonomous action loop.

## Deliverables
- EPIC files: `EP-0120.yaml` .. `EP-0129.yaml` in `project/epics/`.
- Session artifacts: `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md` in this folder.
