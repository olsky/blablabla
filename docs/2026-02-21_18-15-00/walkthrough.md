# Walkthrough — EP-0120..EP-0129 (Hyper-Scale Batch)

## Actions Taken
- Scanned prior EPICs (EP-0001..EP-0119, 85 total) and extracted every buyer, data substrate, and action loop to enforce triple uniqueness.
- Identified 10 sectors with near-zero IT penetration that have transaction volumes or asset pools large enough to support $100M+ Y1 revenue at realistic capture rates.
- Authored 10 EPICs with full ROI, feasibility, risk, and projection sections.

## Sector Selection Logic
Targeted sectors selected for:
- **Massive dormant value** (unclaimed assets $80B+, music royalties $2.5B+/yr unclaimed, food recall costs $55B+/yr).
- **Enormous transaction volume with manual friction** (container repositioning $120B+ waste, pension secondaries $100B+, court filings $300B+ legal spend).
- **Catastrophic unaddressed risk** (wildfire insurance desert, identity compromise, infrastructure failure).
- **Self-serve or viral adoption** — no enterprise sales cycle where possible.

## Governance
- No physical-product-first concepts.
- No illicit, deceptive, or unethical business models.
- Compliance mitigations included per EPIC in risk sections.

## Next Phase (Not Executed Here)
- Run review/aggregation agents.
- Decompose approved EPICs into user stories.
- Plan implementation phase.
