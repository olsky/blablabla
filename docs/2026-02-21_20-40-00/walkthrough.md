# Walkthrough: Global Automotive Sector (EP-0210 to EP-0219)

## Sector Rationale
The multi-trillion dollar automotive industry is a goldmine of untapped data from connected vehicles, EV charging networks, and complex supply chains. This walkthrough outlines 10 autonomous software concepts designed for rapid (sub-3-month) development by AI agents. They focus on high-margin, API-driven services that solve critical industry problems without human intervention.

## The 10 EPIC Concepts

### EP-0210: Autonomous EV Battery Second-Life Marketplace & Arbitrage Engine
**Concept:** An autonomous platform that ingests real-time battery degradation data from EV fleets. When a battery's state-of-health (SoH) drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 80%), the system automatically lists it on a marketplace for second-life applications (like grid storage) and arbitrages the sale for the fleet owner.
**Revenue Model:** 5% commission on every battery pack sold.

### EP-0211: Autonomous Automotive Recall & Service Campaign Recovery Engine
**Concept:** OEMs lose billions on unclaimed service campaigns. This engine autonomously scans vehicle registration databases and OEM service bulletins, identifies affected vehicles, and programmatically contacts owners to facilitate scheduling at dealerships, taking a fee only for successful appointments.
**Revenue Model:** $50 fee paid by the OEM for each successfully scheduled recall service.

### EP-0212: Autonomous Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) Underwriting & Pricing API
**Concept:** A simple API for insurance companies that ingests real-time telematics data (acceleration, braking, speed) from connected cars. An AI model continuously re-prices the driver's insurance premium on a daily or even per-trip basis, offering hyper-personalized rates.
**Revenue Model:** $1 per vehicle per month subscription paid by the insurance carrier.

### EP-0213: Autonomous EV Charging Grid Balancing & Revenue Optimization Service
**Concept:** An agent that connects to thousands of EV chargers and the local power grid. It autonomously adjusts charging speeds across the network based on real-time energy prices and grid demand, selling "demand response" capacity back to the utility during peak hours.
**Revenue Model:** 30% share of the revenue generated from selling grid-balancing services.

### EP-0214: Autonomous Automotive Supplier "Force Majeure" & Disruption Insurance
**Concept:** A parametric insurance product for OEMs. The system monitors real-time news, weather, and shipping data. If a critical supplier's factory is hit by a flood or a key shipping lane is blocked (like the Suez Canal), the policy automatically pays out to the OEM to cover disruption costs.
**Revenue Model:** 10% premium margin.

### EP-0215: Autonomous Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Monetization & Feature Marketplace
**Concept:** An embedded software agent that allows car owners to purchase temporary software-unlocked features (e.g., "Heated Steering Wheel for 24 hours" or "Track Mode for the weekend"). The agent handles the transaction and feature activation/deactivation autonomously.
**Revenue Model:** 20% commission on all micro-transactions.

### EP-0216: Autonomous Automotive Parts Supply Chain & Inventory Pooling Fabric
**Concept:** A network that connects the inventory systems of thousands of dealership service centers. If one dealer is out of a specific part, the system automatically finds the nearest dealer with that part in stock, arranges the transfer, and settles the payment, minimizing service delays.
**Revenue Model:** 3% transaction fee on all inter-dealer parts sales.

### EP-0217: Autonomous Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Energy Arbitrage Pool
**Concept:** An agent that allows EV owners to opt-in their vehicle's battery to an energy trading pool. The agent autonomously charges the vehicle during off-peak hours (low energy cost) and sells power back to the grid during peak hours (high energy cost), generating passive income for the owner.
**Revenue Model:** 20% share of the arbitrage profits.

### EP-0218: Autonomous Automotive Dealership "Digital Twin" & Process Mining Engine
**Concept:** An engine that ingests data from a dealership's management system (DMS), CRM, and website analytics to create a "digital twin" of the entire operation. It uses process mining to identify and quantify bottlenecks (e.g., slow vehicle prep time, sales lead drop-off) and recommends autonomous workflow adjustments.
**Revenue Model:** $10,000/month subscription per dealership.

### EP-0219: Autonomous Used Car Residual Value & Depreciation Insurance
**Concept:** A parametric insurance product for auto lenders and leasing companies. The system ingests real-time used car auction data. If the average residual value for a specific model (e.g., a 3-year-old Tesla Model 3) drops below a pre-agreed floor, the policy automatically pays out to cover the lender's excess depreciation loss.
**Revenue Model:** 1% premium on the value of the vehicle portfolio under management.
