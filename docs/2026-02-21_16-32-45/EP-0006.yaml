title: Supply Chain Disruption Predictor & Sourcing Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** An intelligence oracle that monitors hyper-local global news (translating regional newspapers in real-time), AIS satellite ship-tracking data, and global weather anomaly APIs. When it detects a highly localized disruption (e.g., a specific rare-earth mine strike in South America, or a port micro-climate anomaly), the system mathematically identifies which downstream electronics or manufacturing components will face a sudden supply shock in 3-4 weeks. It autonomously alerts subscribed B2B enterprise procurement teams and simultaneously API-queries alternative global suppliers with current spot prices.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~12 weeks. Synthesizing unstructured multi-lingual news data with physical shipping manifests and mapping it to generic component graphs is a massive data engineering undertaking.
  - Cash Out: High-ticket Enterprise Data Subscriptions ($2,000+ per month/seat).
  
  **First Year Projections:**
  - Active Enterprise Subscriptions: 15
  - Estimated Earnings: $360,000
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 5/10 (Modeling macro-supply chains accurately from stochastic local news events is extremely difficult).
  
  **Risk Analysis:** 
  - Medium Risk: False positives could cause procurement teams to buy unnecessary stock at high spot prices, destroying trust in the oracle.
