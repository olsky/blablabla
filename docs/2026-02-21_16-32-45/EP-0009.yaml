title: Autonomous Compliance Code Injector for Enterprise Devs
description: |
  **Idea:** A B2B developer tool installed as a GitHub App. For heavily regulated industries (Fintech/Healthtech), developers often forget to implement required audit-logging or PII-masking on specific API endpoints. Rather than just a static analysis linter that yells at them, this agent hooks into the PR creation event. It reads the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the new code, detects missing compliance requirements (e.g., "This function touches a `social_security_number` but is missing the GDPR masking wrapper"), and automatically pushes a commit directly into the PR injecting the precise corporate-standard logging and masking code syntax.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~10 weeks. AST parsing and safe, syntactically correct code injection across multiple languages (Python, Go, TypeScript) is incredibly complex.
  - Cash Out: High-ticket Enterprise per-seat licensing.
  
  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise Engineering Orgs: 12
  - Monitored PRs: 20,000
  - Estimated Earnings: $140,000
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 6/10 (Code generation is easy; deterministic, safe, compilable code injection into existing ASTs without breaking the build is very hard).
  
  **Risk Analysis:** 
  - High Risk: If the injected compliance code introduces a logic bug or memory leak, the liability falls on the tool.
