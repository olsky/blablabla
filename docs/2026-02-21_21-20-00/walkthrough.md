# Walkthrough

## Sector thesis
Telecom runs on huge fixed assets and complex revenue logic: spectrum, towers, backhaul, roaming, interconnect, wholesale settlement, and regulatory constraints. Most leakage and missed margin live in reconciliation, dynamic pricing, and event-driven optimization.

## Why startup-feasible in <=3 months
- APIs/data exist: CDRs, RAN telemetry, peering stats, power feeds, billing systems, regulatory notices.
- Immediate monetization via recovered leakage, transaction fees, and optimization take-rates.
- Land-and-expand by corridor, carrier domain, and product line.

## Focus lanes
1. Revenue assurance and reconciliation
2. Spectrum and capacity pricing
3. Tower and energy economics
4. Interconnect/roaming optimization
5. Compliance and penalty prevention
6. Risk/insurance and outage economics
