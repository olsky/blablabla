# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- Build normalized telecom event graph (CDR, RAN, billing, power, peering, contracts).
- Stand up policy engine for compliance, pricing, and settlement constraints.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)
- Ship autonomous loops: detect leakage -> score -> execute recovery/repricing.
- Add explainability + audit trails for disputes and regulatory reviews.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10)
- Launch API-first onboarding and self-serve controls.
- Expand to multi-region rule packs and corridor-specific optimization.

## Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12)
- Hardening, rollback-safe actions, governance thresholds.
- Verify savings and margin lift for performance-based billing.
