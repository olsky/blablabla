# Implementation Plan: Epic 800s (Global Trade Compliance & Logistics Finance)

## Sector Analysis: Global Trade
Global trade is a $25 Trillion market characterized by high fragmentation, archaic paper-based compliance (Bills of Lading), and massive friction in cross-border settlements. Enterprises lose billions to tariff misclassification, sanctions violations, and idle infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Extract $100M+ in first-year revenue through autonomous software agents.
- Drill into niches like HTS classification, Sanctions screening, and CBAM compliance.
- Maintain solo-founder feasibility by leveraging existing global trade APIs and LLMs.

## Deliverables
- `EP-0800.yaml` to `EP-0809.yaml`: 10 unique, non-banal, killer-app Epics.
- Standardized YAML format with ROI, feasibility, and risk analysis.

## Feasibility Guardrails
- 100% Artificial Intelligence / Agent work.
- Max 3-month implementation path.
- Zero physical products.
