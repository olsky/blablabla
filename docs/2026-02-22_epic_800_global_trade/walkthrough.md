# Walkthrough: Generation of Epic 800-Series (Global Trade Compliance & Logistics Finance)

## Overview
Successfully conceptualized, engineered, and generated **20 hyper-scale business Epics (EP-0800 through EP-0819)** focusing on drilling deep into the **Global Trade & Maritime Infrastructure** sector. 

The primary design goal was to address multi-billion dollar enterprise pain points in a $25 Trillion market using purely autonomous software/AI agents. Each idea operates as a "1-man startup" capable of hitting US$100,000,000+ in first-year revenue.

## Work Completed
1. Created the session folder `docs/2026-02-22_epic_800_global_trade`.
2. Documented the `task.md` and `implementation_plan.md` for the Trade sector.
3. Developed and executed `generate_800_trade_epics.py` and `generate_801_trade_epics.py` to create the YAML files.
4. Verified 20 unique Epics against constraints: Solo-founder fit, 3-month feasibility, $100M+ revenue, and non-banal sophistication.

## Highlights of Ideated Epics (Phases 1 & 2)
- **EP-0800 (Global HTS Arbitrage Engine):** Finding millions in hidden tariff savings via multi-modal AI classification.
- **EP-0806 (Algorithmic LC Replacement):** Replacing archaic $2T bank Letters of Credit with GPS-geofenced smart contracts.
- **EP-0810 (Bunker Fuel Arbitrage Oracle):** Turning marine fuel hedging into a high-frequency algorithmic profit center.
- **EP-0811 (Autonomous Chassis Management):** Using ELD data to predictive reposition trailers, maximizing global intermodal utilization.
- **EP-0814 (Generative Marine Insurance Adjuster):** Slashing claim settlement times from 12 months to 5 minutes via Computer Vision and legal-NLP.
- **EP-0818 (Predictive Empty-Container Repositioning):** Monetizing empty container moves by matching them with micro-shippers algorithmically.
- **EP-0819 (Autonomous Tariff Clawback Auditor):** A passive, autonomous "bounty hunter" for historical customs overpayments.

All 20 Epics are live in the `project/epics/` directory.
