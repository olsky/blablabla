title: "Generate Risk Alerts for Suspicious Vessel Patterns"
layer: backend
stack: "Python, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Trigger critical alert when vessel risk score exceeds 80/100"
  - "Trigger high alert when sanctioned vessel detected via IMO/MMSI match"
  - "Trigger medium alert when vessel enters sanctioned zone with transponder on"
  - "Trigger low alert when vessel exhibits 3+ transponder gaps in 30 days"
  - "Include alert payload (vessel ID, risk score, triggering factors, recommended action)"
  - "Deduplicate alerts (no repeat alert for same vessel within 24 hours unless score increases)"
  - "Publish alerts to RabbitMQ message queue for downstream consumption"
  - "Store alert history in PostgreSQL with full audit trail"
