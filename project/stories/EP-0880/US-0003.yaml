title: "Detect AIS Transponder Gaps (Vessels Going Dark)"
layer: backend
stack: "Python, Apache Flink/Spark Streaming"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Monitor expected AIS transmission intervals per vessel class (cargo 10s, tanker 6s per IMO)"
  - "Flag 'transponder gap' event when vessel stops transmitting for >30 minutes"
  - "Calculate gap duration, last known position, and heading at gap start"
  - "Distinguish intentional shutdown vs. technical failure using historical patterns"
  - "Generate gap events with severity score (1-10 based on duration, location, vessel type)"
  - "Store gap events in dedicated table with geospatial indexing"
  - "Achieve <2 minute detection latency from actual gap start"
