title: Autonomous Behavioral Biometric 'Alive-ness' Verification API
description: |
  **Idea:** Deepfakes and RDP (Remote Desktop) tools allow hackers to bypass standard 2FA. This AI agent monitors sub-millisecond mouse movements, keystroke dynamics, and touch-pressure patterns. It mathematically verifies that the entity interacting with the sensitive financial app is a 'Living Biological Human' and not a bot, script, or RDP stream, and autonomously kills the session if any silicon-signature is detected.

  **Why "WOW":** It serves as the ultimate 'Liveness' proof for the digital age. It identifies 'Dead' bot traffic with absolute certainty via behavioral physics.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2.5 months (Building the high-frequency behavioral sensor library and the edge-ML detection models).
  - Cash Out: Usage-based fee ($0.10 per session-security heartbeat).

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Protected Financial Sessions: 2,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Behavioral drift (People's typing patterns change when they are sick or tired), causing false lockouts.
  - Medium: Latency in the heartbeat-check slowing down the user experience.
  - Low: Bank demand (They are losing the war against bot-driven account takeovers).
