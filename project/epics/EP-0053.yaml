title: Autonomous Telecom Roaming Settlement Leakage Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Mobile network operators and MVNOs lose millions annually from roaming/interconnect settlement mismatches. This system ingests TAP/NRTRDE records, bilateral tariff tables, signaling events, fraud markers, and partner invoices, then autonomously reconciles expected vs. billed outcomes.

  Agents detect systematic leakage patterns, generate counter-invoices, execute automated dispute packets, and maintain rolling partner risk scores for contract repricing.

  **Why "WOW":** CFO teams discover immediate hidden margin in a historically opaque, high-volume settlement stack.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (telecom protocol mapping, reconciliation engine, dispute workflows).
  - Cash Out: annual platform license + percentage of validated recovery.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Operators/MVNOs Onboarded: 180
  - Average Annual Recovery per Customer: $420,000
  - Performance Revenue (12%): $9,072,000
  - Platform Revenue: $6,300,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $15,372,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Legacy BSS/OSS integration complexity; mitigated by phased adapters and batch-first onboarding.
  - Medium: Partner-data latency; mitigated through probabilistic reconciliation windows and retroactive adjustment loops.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Operates within telecom settlement agreements and supports transparent bilateral auditability.
