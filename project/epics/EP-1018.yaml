title: "Poultry Feed Mill Recipe & Margin Optimizer"
description: |
  Autonomous agent optimizing feed mill recipes in real-time based on ingredient
  costs, availability, and nutritional constraints. Agents predict ingredient price
  movements, recommend recipe adjustments, and identify arbitrage opportunities on
  commodity markets. Targets feed mills and integrated producers.
problem_statement: |
  Feed represents 55-65% of poultry production costs; feed mill margins are 5-12%.
  Ingredient costs fluctuate daily (corn, soy, amino acids, vitamin premixes).
  Manual recipe management and purchasing is slow; most mills optimize reactively
  monthly. A $0.50/ton recipe improvement = $10M+ value for major mills. Current
  approaches miss real-time arbitrage and ingredient substitution opportunities.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest commodity price feeds (USDA, exchange APIs), current inventory levels,
    and nutritional formulations. Build optimization models accounting for protein,
    energy, amino acid profiles, and processing constraints. Agents recommend recipe
    shifts and purchasing strategies to maximize margin while maintaining quality.
    Integrate with mill ERP/MIS for inventory sync.
  technical_stack: |
    Commodity price APIs (USDA, Platts, exchange feeds), feed mill ERP systems
    (DeLaval, BioControl, local MIS), linear optimization solvers (CBC, Gurobi),
    real-time recipe engine.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per mill ($3K-8K/month) + performance share (1-2% of recipe margin improvements).
business_case:

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 8 weeks. Full: 11 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: ERP integrations vary widely; mitigation: build standardized adapters
  for top 5 mill systems. Business: Formula consistency concerns; mitigation: frame
  as advisory, final approval by nutritionist.
