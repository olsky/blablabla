title: Autonomous Cross-Border Used Machinery VAT Reclaim & Compliance Broker
description: |
  **Idea:** SMEs trading used industrial machinery across EU/UK frequently overpay VAT or miss reclaim windows due to complex cross-border rules. This broker ingests invoices, customs declarations, HS codes, logistics proofs, and local VAT rules. Agents classify transaction intent, compute reclaim eligibility, auto-file electronic reclaims, and reconcile payouts to ERP.

  **Why "WOW":** Turns a tedious, error-prone tax chore into a cash generator for secondary-market machinery dealers and buyers.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (rule engine, customs/VAT adapters, document parser, filing bots).
  - Cash Out: 15% recovery fee + SME subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - SMEs Onboarded: 3,200
  - Average Reclaim per SME: $35,000
  - Recovery Revenue (15%): $16,800,000
  - Subscription Revenue: $2,400,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $19,200,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Evidence completeness; mitigated by multi-doc ingestion and confidence gating before filing.
  - Medium: Rule changes; mitigated with continuous VAT policy updates and automated regression tests.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Files only eligible claims with auditable evidence; complies with VAT law; no aggressive tax evasion tactics.
