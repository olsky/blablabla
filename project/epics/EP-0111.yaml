title: Autonomous Cold-Chain Pharma Excursion Recovery & Routing Optimizer
description: |
  **Idea:** Biologics and vaccines face temperature excursions during transit, leading to waste or disputes. This platform ingests IoT temp/humidity loggers, lane-level SLA data, carrier scan events, and ERP lot records. Agents detect excursion patterns, auto-generate claim evidence for insurers/manufacturers, reroute in-flight shipments to nearest qualified storage, and renegotiate carrier performance credits.

  **Why "WOW":** Shippers recover value from compromised loads while minimizing loss, without adding logistics headcount.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (sensor ingestion mesh, excursion classifier, claim automation, smart rerouting).
  - Cash Out: recovery success fee + lane analytics subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Pharma Shippers: 280
  - Shipments Monitored: 18,000,000
  - Average Recovery per Excursion: $600
  - Success-Fee Revenue (20%): $12,960,000
  - Subscription Revenue: $4,200,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $17,160,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.4/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Data gaps from legacy loggers; mitigated with multi-carrier adapters and inference fills.
  - Medium: Carrier pushback on credits; mitigated via evidence-grade event chains and SLA-referenced claims.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Complies with GDP (Good Distribution Practice) requirements; no falsification of evidence.
