title: "Healthcare Provider Referral Network Intelligence"
description: |
  ML system that analyzes healthcare referral patterns between providers (physicians,
  specialists, hospitals) and identifies optimization opportunities. Recommends referral
  partnerships to reduce patient transfer delays and improve care coordination. Increases
  patient retention 20-30% and revenue per referral relationship.
problem_statement: |
  U.S. healthcare referral coordination costs $100B+ annually (duplicate tests, delayed
  care, poor outcomes). Referrals are fragmented (email, phone, EHR messages); no
  network optimization. Specialists struggle to build referral relationships. Patients
  fall through cracks in transitions.
solution:
  approach: |
    Referral data ingest (EHR referral patterns, outcomes, timing, patient movements) →
    Network analysis (identify key relationships, gaps) → Partnership recommendations →
    Outcome tracking (patient outcomes, cost per case) → Feedback for continuous improvement
  technical_stack:
    - Data: EHR APIs (Epic, Cerner), claims databases, patient outcome data
    - ML: Network analysis, recommendation engines, outcome prediction
    - Agents: Partnership alerts, outcome monitoring
  revenue_model: "SaaS per health system ($5K-20K/month) + outcome bonuses"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.4
  target_users_estimate: 45
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2963
feasibility_score: 8.2
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (EHR integration → referral pattern analysis → network optimization → outcome tracking)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: HIPAA compliance (patient privacy); mitigation = de-identified data flows.
  Adoption: Healthcare IT integration complexity; mitigation = health system partnerships.
  Outcome: Patient outcome data quality varies; mitigation = focus on high-quality systems first.
