title: Generative 'Debt-Covenant' Compliance Guardian
description: |
  **Idea:** Banks loan billions to companies contingent on 'Covenants' (e.g. debt-to-equity ratio). Companies accidentally break these every day due to accounting delays. This AI agent sits as a 'Silent Guardian' on the company's ledger. It autonomously predicts if a covenant will be broken in 14 days and suggests specific algorithmic spending-freezes or asset-sales to stay compliant.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the 'Financial Radar' for corporate CEOs. It prevents the bank from taking over the company via autonomous, early-warning compliance.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the predictive covenant-violation models and integrating with ERP/Banking firehoses).
  - Cash Out: Enterprise SaaS: $50k/month per large-cap borrower.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Corporate Clients: 250
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The AI suggesting an 'Asset Sale' that is strategically disastrous for the company's long-term future.
  - Medium: Banks disallowing 'Autonomous Covenant Remediation' and demanding a human CFO signature.
  - Low: CEO Demand (They hate being in 'technical default' to the bank).
