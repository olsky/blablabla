title: "Turkey Production & Seasonality Demand Forecaster"
description: |
  Autonomous forecasting system predicting turkey demand (holiday peaks, restaurant
  contracts) and recommending optimal production batch scheduling to minimize
  inventory holding costs while meeting customer commitments. Agents coordinate with
  hatcheries and processing plants.
problem_statement: |
  Turkey production is highly seasonal (Thanksgiving, Christmas peaks). Producers
  must commit to hatcheries 12-16 weeks ahead of delivery. Forecast errors are
  costly: over-production ties up capital; under-production loses sales. Current
  forecasting is manual and conservative (avoid stockouts). A 5% improvement in
  forecast accuracy = $50M+ industry value.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest turkey demand signals from customers (restaurants, retailers, food
    service), historical sales patterns, and market intelligence (inflation, labor
    costs, consumer trends). Build time-series forecast models (Prophet, LSTM) of
    demand by product type and region. Agent recommends production batch sizes and
    timing to minimize total cost (carrying costs + stockout risk).
  technical_stack: |
    Customer order management systems (EDI, APIs), retailer POS data (Nielsen,
    Syndigo), forecast models (Prophet, LSTM), inventory optimization.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per producer ($5K-15K/month) + performance share (2-4% of working capital
    reduction).

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 9 weeks. Full: 13 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Customer data access limited; mitigation: partner with major turkey
  producers (Butterball, Jennie-O) for pilot data. Business: Long lead times mean
  forecast errors compound; mitigation: early warning system for demand shifts.
