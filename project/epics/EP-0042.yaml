title: Autonomous Real-Time Contract Risk Scoring API
description: |
  **Idea:** Fortune 500 companies sign thousands of contracts per year. Each carries hidden risk — liability caps buried in schedules, unusual indemnification, auto-renewal traps, jurisdiction clauses. This platform exposes a single API endpoint: submit a contract PDF, receive a machine-readable risk scorecard in <2 seconds. Autonomous agents parse clauses using fine-tuned LLMs, cross-reference against a library of 2M+ known "dangerous" clause patterns, score by risk category (financial, IP, operational, regulatory), and output structured JSON reports. It integrates into DocuSign, Salesforce, and M&A data rooms as a native plugin.

  **Why "WOW":** Legal review of a single enterprise contract costs $500-$3,000 in lawyer time. This does it in 2 seconds for $5. Every corporate law team, procurement department, and startup that touches contracts immediately becomes a user.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (LLM fine-tuning on legal datasets, API infrastructure, plugin adapters).
  - Cash Out: $5/contract API call + $2k/month enterprise SaaS subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - API Calls: 4,000,000 (DocuSign alone processes 1B+ docs/year)
  - Enterprise Subscribers: 600
  - Estimated Earnings: $34,400,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10 (Large language models are highly capable at contract analysis; legal NLP is a mature field. Integration APIs for DocuSign exist. Time-to-market is fast.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Liability if a missed clause leads to a legal dispute; mitigated by "informational, not legal advice" disclaimer.
  - Low: Technical complexity. LLM contract analysis is well-proven.
  - Low: Adoption friction — direct DocuSign plugin removes integration barrier entirely.
