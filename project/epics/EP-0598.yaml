title: Predictive Pandemic & Pathogen Vector Tracker
description: |
  **Idea:** Governments rely on lagging hospital data to spot outbreaks (COVID). This global defense engine ingests anonymized municipal wastewater sequencing APIs (which detect viral RNA in sewage) and correlates it with global airline ticketing/manifest data. It uses graph-neural-networks to mathematically model the true vector spread of a novel pathogen weeks before people show symptoms, autonomously alerting supply chains to route PPE/vaccines to the predicted epicenters.

  **Why "WOW":** Algorithmic pandemic defense. It tracks biological threats moving via global infrastructure in real-time.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Aggregating the fragmented global wastewater genomics data and airline APIs).
  - Cash Out: Massive government contracts (DoD/CDC) and premium intelligence feeds to global shipping logistics firms ($10M/yr).

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Tier-1 Sovereign/Enterprise Clients: 15
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The collapse of global wastewater testing infrastructure (If cities stop testing, the model goes blind).
  - Medium: False positives triggering massive, unnecessary supply-chain panic.
  - Low: Government funding (Biosecurity is a top national defense priority).
