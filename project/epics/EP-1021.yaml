title: "Poultry Antibiotic & Therapeutic Stewardship Agent"
description: |
  Autonomous system recommending targeted antibiotic or probiotic interventions based
  on flock history, regional disease patterns, and sensitivity profiles. Agents
  predict disease risk and recommend minimal-intervention strategies compliant with
  regulations (no growth promotants, therapeutic-only use).
problem_statement: |
  Antibiotic use in poultry is under global regulatory pressure (EU ban on growth
  promoters, US restrictions). Producers face a balance between productivity and
  compliance. Unnecessary antibiotics increase costs and resistance; under-treatment
  increases mortality. Current approaches are reactive or overly broad. A smart
  stewardship system could reduce antibiotic use by 30-50% while maintaining
  performance.
solution:
  approach: |
    Build risk models of disease based on flock genetics, age, climate, prior
    health events, and regional disease surveillance (USDA, state reports). Agents
    recommend targeted prophylaxis or probiotics only when risk is high. Track
    sensitivity profiles from diagnostic labs. Predict response to interventions.
  technical_stack: |
    Diagnostic lab results (API from major labs), flock data (integrator MIS),
    disease surveillance APIs, veterinary knowledge base, recommendation engine
    with regulatory compliance checks.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per integrator or producer ($3K-10K/month) + performance share (5-10%
    of avoided treatment costs or regulatory fines).

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 9 weeks. Full: 13 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Diagnostic lab integrations limited; mitigation: start with major labs
  (IDEXX, Neogen), expand over time. Business: Veterinary liability; mitigation:
  frame as decision support, require veterinary sign-off on all recommendations.
