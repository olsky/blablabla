title: Algorithmic Synthetic-Identity Detection Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Fraudsters create 'Frankenstein' identities by combining real SSNs with fake names/addresses to build credit and then 'bust out' for millions. This AI agent uses graph-neural-networks to analyze global SSN issuance dates, utility-bill-paying patterns, and digital exhaust. It identifies the mathematical signature of a 'constructed' human who has no childhood data footprint and autonomously prevents them from opening institutional credit lines.

  **Why "WOW":** It identifies humans that don't actually exist with 99.9% accuracy. It stops the 'perfect' fraud that human underwriters miss every time.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Training the GNN on massive anonymized KYC datasets and digital-exhaust APIs).
  - Cash Out: $5.00 per 'Synthetic-Check' API call.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - KYC/Identity Checks Processed: 30,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Legitimate immigrants or those with 'thin' credit files being incorrectly classified as synthetic.
  - Medium: Fraudsters learning to 'seed' fake childhood data into the AI's data sources.
  - Low: Enterprise demand (Synthetic identity is the #1 growth area in fintech fraud).
