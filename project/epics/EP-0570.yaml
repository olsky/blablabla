title: Autonomous Supply Chain Disruption Predictor
description: |
  **Idea:** Global supply chains break constantly (Suez Canal blockage, factory fires). This system monitors alternative signals: shipping vessel AIS radar, local foreign language news sentiment, thermal satellite imagery of factories, and global union strike databases. It uses causal ML to mathematically predict a component shortage 4 weeks before the OEM realizes it. It is integrated into the OEM's ERP and autonomously executes purchase orders from secondary suppliers before the global shortage spikes the price.

  **Why "WOW":** Predicts the future of global logistics and executes financial hedging instantly without humans.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Massive global API ingestion and complex causal graph neural network training).
  - Cash Out: Enterprise SaaS ($1M/yr for Fortune 500 manufacturing).

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise Deployments: 120
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The "Butterfly Effect"—global logistics are chaotic and highly prone to ML misprediction (false alarms).
  - Medium: Enterprises refusing to let an algorithm automatically spend millions on alternative P.O.s without human sign-off.
  - Low: Demand (Every supply chain manager is traumatized by COVID shortages).
