title: Autonomous 'Algorithmic-Transparency' Compliance Ledger
description: |
  **Idea:** Regulators want to know *why* an AI made a decision (e.g. why did the AI deny this loan?). This system acts as a 'Black Box Flight Recorder' for AI models. It sits on the corporate network and autonomously generates a ZK-proof of the specific 'Decision-Logic-Path' for every single transaction, hashing it to an immutable ledger for the auditor.

  **Why "WOW":** It solves the 'Black Box' problem of AI. It provides 100% regulatory-verified 'Explainability' without ever exposing the company's private training data.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Building the high-speed ZK-decision-recorder and the institutional compliance-ledger).
  - Cash Out: $0.10 per transaction 'Proof-of-Logic' generated.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - AI Decisions Recorded/Hashed: 1,500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The 'Explainability Proof' being so complex that the human regulator can't understand it, failing the audit.
  - Medium: Computational overhead of generating ZK-proofs for billions of small-ticket AI decisions.
  - Low: Legal Necessity (The AI Act will mandate this for 'High Risk' models).
