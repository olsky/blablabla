title: "Loan Servicing Collections Optimization Engine"
description: |
  ML system for mortgage servicers and lenders that optimizes collections strategies
  for delinquent loans. Predicts which borrowers will cure, which will default, and
  recommends intervention strategy (modification, forbearance, reinstatement). Increases
  recovery rates by 15-25%.
problem_statement: |
  $10T+ mortgage market; $500B+ in delinquent loans. Lenders use reactive strategies
  (phone calls, letters); no predictive optimization. Borrower response to intervention
  is variable; no personalization. Modification/forbearance programs are under-utilized
  prior to foreclosure.
solution:
  approach: |
    Loan & borrower data ingest (payment history, income, property value, credit score,
    prior modifications) → Cure/default prediction → Intervention optimization (which
    strategy for which borrower) → Communication orchestration (email, SMS, phone) →
    Outcome tracking (cure, default, loss mitigation success)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: LMS (loan servicing systems), credit bureaus, property records, employment data
    - ML: Cure likelihood prediction, intervention targeting
    - Agents: Communication orchestration, modification workflows
  revenue_model: "SaaS per servicer ($10K-30K/month) + % of avoided defaults (5-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2500000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 30
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 6944
feasibility_score: 8.3
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (LMS integration → cure/default prediction → intervention orchestration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Fair Lending compliance; mitigation = algorithm auditing + no protected attribute usage.
  Regulatory: Mortgage servicing is regulated (Dodd-Frank); mitigation = compliance review.
  Operational: Servicers conservative; mitigation = pilot with enlightened players.
