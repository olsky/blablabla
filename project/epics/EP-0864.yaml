title: Autonomous Parametric 'Pandemic' Supply-Chain Insurance
description: |
  **Idea:** COVID-19 showed that supply chains have zero pandemic protection. This system monitors WHO health firehoses and local airport 'Febrile-Screening' data via API. When a disease-incidence score crosses a specific 'Epidemiological Threshold' in a manufacturing hub (e.g. Shenzhen), the smart-contract releases 'Interruption Funds' to the buyer to find alternative suppliers immediately.

  **Why "WOW":** It serves as the 'Epidemiological Firewall' for global trade. It provides instant liquidity to pivot supply-chains *before* a city is locked down.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Pipelining global health-data and building the supply-chain-pivot re-insurance structures).
  - Cash Out: 1.5% premium on the value of the supply-chain being protected.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Supply-Chain Value under Protection: $20,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $300,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: WHO/Government health data being suppressed by the manufacturing country until it's too late for the AI to trigger the payout.
  - Medium: Complexity of defining 'Epidemiological Thresholds' that are both sensitive and non-manipulatable.
  - Low: Brand Demand (CEO's are haunted by the memory of the 2020 lockdowns).
