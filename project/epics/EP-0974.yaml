title: "API Monetization & Rate Limit Optimization Engine"
description: |
  ML system for API platforms (Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid) that optimizes rate limits
  and pricing tiers to maximize revenue while minimizing customer churn. Recommends
  per-customer rate limits based on usage patterns and payment history.
problem_statement: |
  $100B+ API economy; most platforms leave money on table via suboptimal pricing/limits.
  Rate limits are static; no dynamic personalization. Usage-based pricing lacks sophistication.
solution:
  approach: |
    Usage data ingest (API calls, errors, latency) → Customer value ranking → Revenue
    optimization → Price/rate limit recommendations → A/B testing framework
  technical_stack:
    - Data: API gateway logs, billing systems
    - ML: Customer lifetime value modeling, price elasticity
    - Agents: Rate limit adjustment, pricing recommendations
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($5K-20K/month) + revenue share (2-5%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1800000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 35
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 4286
feasibility_score: 8.7
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (API gateway integration → revenue optimization → pricing engine)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: API platform specificity; mitigation = start with REST APIs only.
  Business: Customer perception of "rate limit as profit lever"; mitigation = transparency + fairness.
  Adoption: Platform teams cautious; mitigation = pilot with single customer first.
