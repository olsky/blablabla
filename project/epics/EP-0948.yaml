title: "Water Utility Pipe Failure Prediction & Preventive Maintenance"
description: |
  ML system for water utilities that predicts pipe failures (breaks, leaks) 6-12 months
  in advance using soil conditions, pipe age, material composition, break history, and
  system pressure data. Optimizes maintenance scheduling to prevent catastrophic failures
  and reduce water loss. Integrates with SCADA systems and GIS databases.
problem_statement: |
  U.S. water loss costs $40B+ annually (30-50% of water in distribution systems lost
  to breaks). Pipes break reactively (emergency repairs cost 10x preventive); no prediction
  capability. Aging infrastructure (average pipe age 45+ years); replacement rates are
  inadequate. Cities lack maintenance budget visibility.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest system data (pipe inventory from GIS, pressure monitors, soil maps, break history) →
    Feature engineering (pipe age, soil corrosivity, historical breaks, depth, material) →
    Survival analysis + gradient boosting for failure prediction → Maintenance scheduling
    optimization → Asset prioritization
  technical_stack:
    - Data: GIS APIs, SCADA systems, soil databases (USGS), weather data
    - ML: Survival analysis, gradient boosting for time-to-failure prediction
    - Agents: Maintenance scheduling, risk ranking
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($3K-15K/month) + % of avoided emergency repair costs (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1500000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 35
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3571
feasibility_score: 8.3
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (GIS/SCADA integration → failure prediction model → maintenance optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legacy water system IT infrastructure; mitigation = support multiple protocols.
  Operational: Conservative infrastructure operators; mitigation = pilot program with proofs.
  Market: Tight municipal budgets; mitigation = show ROI on deferred replacement.
