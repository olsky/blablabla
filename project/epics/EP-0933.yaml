title: "Food Delivery Route Optimization & Time Prediction Engine"
description: |
  Real-time route optimization for food delivery networks (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub)
  using live traffic data, order clustering, and delivery driver availability. Predicts
  accurate delivery windows (within 2-3 min). Reduces delivery costs by 15-25% while
  improving on-time performance.
problem_statement: |
  $150B+ food delivery market losing $15-20B annually to inefficient routing. Most
  platforms use greedy algorithms (nearest driver); no ML-based clustering/sequencing.
  Delivery time prediction accuracy directly impacts customer retention (late orders
  yield 2-3x churn). Driver utilization is 65-75% (inefficient).
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest order stream + driver/vehicle telemetry + traffic API (Google Maps,
    HERE Maps) → Dynamic order clustering (Hungarian algorithm, ML-based) →
    Route optimization (genetic algorithm) → Delivery time prediction → Real-time
    reassignment agents
  technical_stack:
    - APIs: Google Maps/HERE, delivery platform webhooks, traffic streams
    - Optimization: Genetic algorithms, deep learning (LSTM) for ETA
    - Real-time: Kafka/Redis for streaming, async orchestration
  revenue_model: "Revenue share on delivery savings (5-8% of reduced delivery costs) + API fees per 1K transactions"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 4200000
  roi_time_in_months: 0.8
  target_users_estimate: 110
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3182
feasibility_score: 8.8
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Route optimization engine → traffic API integration → ETA model → real-time orchestration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Real-time optimization at scale is computationally expensive; mitigation = edge compute.
  Business: Competing with Uber/DoorDash internal optimization; mitigation = focus on 3PL/SME operators.
  Operational: Driver autonomy concerns; mitigation = recommendations vs. mandates.
