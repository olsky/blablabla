title: "Academic Research Paper Citation Verification Engine"
description: |
  Autonomous system that verifies citations in academic papers by fetching full-text
  papers, cross-referencing claims, and identifying misquotations, misattributions, or
  context omissions. Indexes arXiv, PubMed, SSRN, and institution repositories. Helps
  researchers, publishers, and grant agencies detect citation fraud.
problem_statement: |
  $30B+ annual research funding (~20% of $150B R&D spending) goes to papers with
  citation errors. 10-30% of citations contain inaccuracies; 2-5% are deliberately
  fraudulent. Peer review relies on spot-checking; no systematic verification exists.
  Retractions due to citation fraud destroy careers and waste resources.
solution:
  approach: |
    Paper metadata extraction → Citation list parsing → Fetch referenced papers (API + OCR) →
    Claim extraction → Semantic similarity matching → Flagsuspicious citations → Generate
    reports with specificity/context gaps
  technical_stack:
    - Data: arXiv API, PubMed API, SSRN, institution repositories, Google Scholar
    - ML: NLP for claim extraction, semantic matching (embeddings), citation context analysis
    - Infrastructure: Paper downloading, full-text indexing, caching
  revenue_model: "B2B2C (universities pay $5K-20K/yr) + publisher integrations + grant agency licensing"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1200000
  roi_time_in_months: 2.0
  target_users_estimate: 55
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1818
feasibility_score: 8.4
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Paper API integration → citation parsing → claim extraction → semantic matching)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Citation formats vary widely; mitigation = normalize top 80% standards.
  Legal: Copyright of full-text papers; mitigation = academic fair use + licensing agreements.
  Market: Adoption requires culture shift in academia; mitigation = start with grant agencies/publishers.
