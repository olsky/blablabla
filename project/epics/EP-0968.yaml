title: "Enterprise Data Governance & Privacy Compliance Automation"
description: |
  ML system that maps data flow across enterprise (SaaS apps, databases, data warehouses,
  vendors), enforces data governance policies, and ensures GDPR/CCPA/data privacy compliance.
  Detects unauthorized data access, suspicious transfers, and policy violations. Reduces
  compliance risk and audit friction by 50-70%.
problem_statement: |
  Enterprise data governance is fragmented (10-30 different systems/vendors); no centralized
  visibility. GDPR/CCPA violations cost $25M-$4B in fines. Data stewardship is manual;
  audits take weeks. Shadow IT and unapproved SaaS proliferation create compliance gaps.
solution:
  approach: |
    System discovery (network scanning, vendor surveys, API enumeration) → Data inventory
    mapping (source, destination, processing) → Classification (PII, sensitive, public) →
    Policy enforcement (access controls, encryption, retention) → Monitoring (unauthorized
    access, anomalous transfers) → Compliance reporting (GDPR, CCPA, SOC2)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Network APIs, SaaS app APIs (Okta, Workday), data discovery engines
    - ML: Data classification (PII detection), anomaly detection, policy violations
    - Orchestration: Automated remediation, policy enforcement
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($10K-50K/month) + audit/compliance services"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2800000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 50
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 4667
feasibility_score: 8.4
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "10 weeks (System discovery → data mapping → classification → policy enforcement)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: System integration complexity (100+ SaaS apps); mitigation = modular discovery.
  Legal: Data governance audit requirements; mitigation = compliance team partnership.
  Business: Requires CyberSec buy-in; mitigation = position as risk department enabling tool.
