title: AI-Directed 'Dividend-Capture' Arbitrage across Global Ledgers
description: |
  **Idea:** Stock dividends and on-chain 'Yield Distributions' happen on different days in different timezones. This AI agent monitors 10,000+ global yields. It algorithmically moves its capital from 'Post-Dividend' assets to 'Pre-Dividend' assets every 24 hours, capturing the distribution 'Capture' efficiency that humans cannot execute at scale.

  **Why "WOW":** It operates as a 'Yield Vampire'. It extracts the highest possible margin from the global capital pulse via sub-second movements.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the global dividend-calendar oracle and the high-speed cross-ledger routing bots).
  - Cash Out: Pure arbitrage profit (Targeting 30% annual yield on principal).

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Principal under Management: $500,000,000\n  - Annual Yield: 30%
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The 'Dividend-Drop' (The price of a stock falling by the value of the dividend) being larger than the dividend itself, leading to a loss.
  - Medium: High transaction taxes in specific countries (UK/France) killing the arbitrage margin.
  - Low: Capital Efficiency (It is the ultimate hands-off growth machine).
