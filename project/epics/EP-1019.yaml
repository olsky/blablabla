title: "Poultry Farm-to-Processing Logistics & Hang-Time Optimizer"
description: |
  Autonomous logistic orchestration system managing transport timing, route
  optimization, and live bird landing schedules. Agents predict hang times, flock
  stress levels, and optimal depop windows to minimize mortality in transit and
  upon arrival. Targets contract growers and integrators.
problem_statement: |
  Transport mortality (death loss during catching, loading, transit, holding) costs
  operators $500M+ annually and represents 2-6% of final flock value. Stress during
  transport degrades meat quality (blood splash, bruising). No real-time system
  currently optimizes transport timing or live bird inventory balance. Early catch
  = early mortality; late catch = stress and quality loss.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest flock data (age, weight gain trajectory, health status), weather
    forecasts, and processing plant availability. Agents predict optimal catch
    timing, recommend transport schedules, and optimize hang times at holding areas.
    Coordinate with plant to minimize pre-processing hold times. Predict stress
    indicators and recommend pre-transport conditioning.
  technical_stack: |
    Farm management systems (flock growth curves), weather APIs, integrator ERP
    (processing schedules), live bird transport telematics (where available), IoT
    sensors in holding areas.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per integrator ($4K-12K/month) + performance share (4-6% of mortality reduction value).
business_case:

  roi_time_in_months: 1.2

  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2706
feasibility_score: 8.3
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 8 weeks. Full: 12 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Transport fleet telematics limited; mitigation: use farm-side sensors
  and processing timestamps. Business: Coordination across parties (catch crews, drivers,
  plant) complex; mitigation: start with single integrator pilots.
