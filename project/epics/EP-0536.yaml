title: AI-Directed Orbital Debris Salvage Bounty Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Low Earth Orbit is cluttered with deadly, multi-million dollar dead satellites. This system ingests US Space Command orbital trajectories and builds a highly liquid bounty marketplace. Space salvage startups (like Astroscale) view the algorithmic bounties (e.g., $15M to de-orbit Cosmos 1408). The system algorithmically verifies the de-orbit via radar APIs and instantly clears the payment from the stakeholder (governments/telcos) to the salvage startup.

  **Why "WOW":** The first automated financial clearinghouse for space janitors. Creates the economic incentive to clean orbit.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Integrating orbital mechanics verification and smart contract bounties).
  - Cash Out: 5% clearing fee on all salvaged orbital mass.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Bounties Cleared: $2,500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Securing the initial upfront bounty capital from governments.
  - Medium: Verification via public radar data.
  - Low: Startup participation (They need the revenue).
