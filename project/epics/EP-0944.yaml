title: "Medical Insurance Claim Denial Appeal Automation"
description: |
  ML system that automatically identifies wrongly denied medical claims, compiles appeals
  with evidence/precedent, and submits to insurance companies. Recovers denied claims
  worth $50K-$500K annually per hospital/provider. Integrates with EHR systems (Epic,
  Cerner) and claims databases.
problem_statement: |
  15-25% of medical claims are denied initially (incorrect diagnosis code, missing auth,
  medical necessity disputes). Appeals are labor-intensive (manual documentation review,
  evidence gathering, written submission). Providers recover only 30-35% of denied claims
  due to administrative cost. Industry leaves $50B+ unclaimed annually.
solution:
  approach: |
    Claims data ingest (EHR + insurance denial codes) → Identify appealable denials
    (categorize by denial reason) → Gather clinical evidence from EHR → Match to
    coverage policies + precedent cases → Generate appeal letter with evidence →
    Auto-submit to insurer → Track outcomes
  technical_stack:
    - Data: EHR APIs (Epic, Cerner), claims databases, insurance policy mapping
    - ML: Denial classification, precedent matching (similarity search)
    - Agents: Appeal generation, submission tracking, outcome monitoring
  revenue_model: "% of recovered claim amounts (15-25%, success-based) + annual licensing"
business_case:

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (EHR integration → denial classification → evidence gathering → appeal generation)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Insurance regulation requires human oversight of appeals; mitigation = compliance review required.
  Operational: Insurance company response rates variable; mitigation = automated tracking + escalation.
  Business: Requires case law database maintenance; mitigation = subscribe to insurance policy feeds.
