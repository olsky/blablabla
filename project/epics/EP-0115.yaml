title: Autonomous Wind Curtailment Revenue Reclamation & Forecasting Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Wind farms lose revenue to grid curtailment orders and imbalance charges. This engine ingests SCADA production, curtailment signals, day-ahead/real-time prices, congestion maps, and weather forecasts. Agents forecast curtailment risk, auto-bid flexibility products, file compensation claims where applicable, and adjust dispatch/maintenance schedules to minimize loss.

  **Why "WOW":** Converts curtailment pain into reclaimable revenue and proactive avoidance, boosting project IRR without adding operators.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (market connectors, SCADA adapters, forecasting models, claim automation).
  - Cash Out: platform SaaS + 12% share of recovered/avoided curtailment value.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Wind Sites: 520
  - Average Annual Recovery per Site: $45,000
  - Performance Revenue: $2,808,000
  - SaaS Revenue: $8,700,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $11,508,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.1/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Grid rule variance; mitigated by market-specific policy modules.
  - Medium: Forecast error; mitigated via ensemble models and conservative bidding.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Aligned with grid participation rules; transparent measurement for compensation filings.
