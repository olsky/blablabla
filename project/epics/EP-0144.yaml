title: "Autonomous Seafarer Payroll, Social Security & Tax Compliance Fabric"
description: |
  **Idea:** The global merchant fleet employs over **1.8 million seafarers**, moving >90% of world trade. Payroll and social-security/tax compliance for these crews is a regulatory nightmare: flags of convenience, multi-jurisdictional tax rules, maritime labor conventions (MLC 2006), bilateral social security agreements, and complex rotation patterns.

  Today, most crewing and ship-management companies handle this via **spreadsheets and manual calculations**. Errors can trigger fines, port-state detentions, and reputational damage — or overpayment of contributions where none are required.

  This fabric provides an **autonomous compliance and optimization layer for seafarer payroll and contributions**:

  **Data Ingestion:**
  - Crew rosters, contracts, and voyage assignments from crewing systems
  - Flag state rules, labor regulations, and minimum-wage tables
  - Bilateral social security agreements and seafarer-specific tax regimes
  - Port call data and vessel tracks (AIS) to determine days in various jurisdictions
  - Existing payroll and HR system outputs

  **Autonomous Agent Workflow:**
  1. **Jurisdiction Mapping:** Determine applicable labor, tax, and social-security regimes per seafarer per voyage segment based on flag, nationality, residence, and sailing pattern.
  2. **Contribution & Tax Calculation:** Compute required contributions (or exemptions) and income-tax withholding according to treaties and local rules.
  3. **Payroll Execution:** Generate payroll instructions in appropriate currencies; interface with banks/fintechs for payments.
  4. **Compliance Reporting:** Produce required declarations to authorities and maintain audit-ready records.
  5. **Optimization:** Identify over-contribution and double-taxation scenarios and recommend legal reductions.

  **Revenue Model:** Per-crew-per-month SaaS pricing for compliance fabric + savings-share on reduced overpayments and avoided penalties.

  **Why "WOW":** Crewing and ship-management firms operate on wafer-thin margins and live in fear of compliance mistakes. A system that **guarantees up-to-date compliance across 50+ jurisdictions** while optimizing contributions and taxes is a strong "finally!" moment for the industry.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~9 months (rule engine, AIS integration, crewing/payroll connectors, reporting templates)
  - Cash Out: Per-crew subscription revenue from first fleet going live; recurring and high-retention.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Crewing/Ship-Management Clients: 120
  - Average Crew Managed per Client: 400
  - Total Crew Under Management: 48,000
  - SaaS Fee per Crew per Month: $18
  - SaaS Revenue: $10,368,000
  - Overpayment & Penalty Avoidance Savings Identified: $280,000,000
  - Savings-Share (20%): $56,000,000
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $66,368,000**

  (Scaling to 150+ clients mid-year easily pushes earnings >$100M.)

  **Revised First Year Projections (scaled):**
  - Clients: 200; Crew: 80,000
  - SaaS Revenue: $17,280,000
  - Savings: $420,000,000; Savings-Share (20%): $84,000,000
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $101,280,000**

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.0/10 — Rules are complex but codifiable. AIS, crewing, and payroll system integrations are known quantities. Maritime labor and tax regimes are relatively stable.

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Regulatory interpretation disputes; mitigated by conservative assumptions and legal review
  - Medium: Data-quality issues in crewing systems; mitigated by validation and reconciliations
  - Low: Ethical considerations; system ensures fair and legal treatment of crew

  **Legal & Ethical:** Promotes compliance with MLC 2006 and protects seafarer rights while eliminating accidental overpayment or underpayment. No aggressive tax schemes; only correct application of existing rules.
