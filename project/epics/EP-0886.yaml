title: AI-Driven 'High-Net-Worth' Global Tax-Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Hedge funds and billionaires pay millions for tax lawyers. This AI agent ingests every double-taxation-treaty and OECD 'BEPS' regulation. It monitors the user's global wealth-ledgers and autonomously identifies 24-hour 'Tax-Free Windows' for moving profits, executing the shifts via bank-API to ensure the absolute legally-lowest tax rate globally.

  **Why "WOW":** It provides 'Global-Partner-Level' tax expertise at sub-second speed. It turns a static legal liability into a high-frequency profit engine.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Complex legal-NLP for tax-treaties and secure bank-movement API rails).
  - Cash Out: 15% performance fee on the net-tax-savings identified.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Tax Savings Generated for Clients: $1,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Governments passing 'General Anti-Avoidance Rules' (GAAR) to retroactively punish algorithmic treaty-hopping.
  - Medium: Maintaining an up-to-the-second database of global tax-reulings which change daily.
  - Low: Market Demand (The wealthy spend millions to save millions; adoption is seamless).
