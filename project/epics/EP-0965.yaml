title: "Retail Promotional Effectiveness & Price Elasticity Intelligence"
description: |
  ML system that measures actual ROI of retail promotions by analyzing incremental sales
  lift, profitability impact, and cross-category effects. Recommends optimal promotion
  timing, depth, and format. Reduces promotional waste by 20-30% and increases margin
  by 5-15%.
problem_statement: |
  Retailers spend $500B+ annually on promotions; 30-40% have negative ROI (margin loss
  exceeds revenue uplift). Most promotions are competitive reactions (not optimized).
  Pricing strategy is rule-based (% off); no ML-based optimization. Promotion effectiveness
  is measured weeks/months after execution (too late to optimize).
solution:
  approach: |
    POS & inventory data ingest (baseline sales, promotion events, pricing) → Baseline
    demand estimation → Incremental lift estimation → Profit model (margin-aware) →
    Cross-category effects analysis → Recommendation engine (optimal promotion depth,
    frequency, format, timing)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: POS systems, inventory databases, promotional calendars
    - ML: Causal inference (propensity scoring), promotion response models
    - Agents: Promotion recommendations, real-time adjustment monitoring
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-8K/month) + % of recovered promotional profit (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1900000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 85
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2235
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (POS integration → demand estimation → lift measurement → recommendation engine)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: POS system fragmentation; mitigation = focus on top 50% (Oracle Retail, SAP).
  Business: Retailers data-sensitive; mitigation = competitive anonymity for benchmarking.
  Adoption: Price-setting is political in orgs; mitigation = collaborative approach with merchants.
