title: Autonomous Code Vulnerability Auto-Patching Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** The average organization takes 197 days to identify and patch a critical vulnerability. This platform autonomously monitors CVE databases, package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven), and project dependency graphs (ingested via CI/CD webhook). When a new CVE is published that affects a registered codebase, the system automatically:
  (1) clones the affected branch,
  (2) applies the minimum-viable dependency bump or code patch using LLM-guided AST mutation,
  (3) runs the existing test suite in an ephemeral sandbox,
  (4) if green, opens a pull request with a full CVE explanation and patch rationale.
  Zero human steps until the PR review. Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket natively.

  **Why "WOW":** Security teams are drowning in CVE alerts. PR-ready patches arrive before the morning standup. CISOs will mandate this tool across every engineering team in the company the same week they see the first auto-patched critical.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months (CVE ingestion pipeline, dependency graph engine, LLM AST patcher, safe sandbox runner, GitHub App).
  - Cash Out: $500-$5,000/month per organization based on number of repos.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Organizations: 12,000
  - Average Plan: $1,200/month
  - Estimated Earnings: $21,600,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10 (GitHub App ecosystem is mature; CVE feeds are public APIs; LLM code editing at dependency-bump level is highly reliable. Sandboxed test runners are commodity.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: A bad auto-patch could introduce a regression or new vulnerability; mitigated by mandatory test-suite gate before PR creation.
  - Low: Technical complexity — all individual components are well-understood; challenge is orchestration quality.
