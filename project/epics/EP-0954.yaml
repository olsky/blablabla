title: "Customer Service Chatbot Escalation Optimization"
description: |
  ML system that routes customer service issues to optimal resolution path (self-service
  bot, tier 1 agent, specialist, escalation). Learns which issues require human intervention
  and prioritizes high-value customer interactions for specialist handling. Integrates with
  existing chatbot platforms (Intercom, Drift, Zendesk).
problem_statement: |
  Customer service costs $100B+ annually; 30-50% of chatbot-to-human escalations are
  unnecessary (customer repeats intent). Wait times for human agents cost businesses
  $1B+ annually in churn. Most escalation routing is rule-based (not ML-optimized).
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest customer interaction data (chat transcripts, customer value, issue history,
    resolution outcome) → Feature extraction (sentiment, intent, customer lifetime value,
    issue complexity) → Route optimization model → Prediction of resolution likelihood
    for each path → Continuous outcome feedback
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Chat platform APIs (Intercom, Zendesk), CRM integration
    - ML: Intent classification, customer value modeling, routing optimization
    - Integration: Existing chatbot/helpdesk systems
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($1K-5K/month) + % of avoided escalation costs (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 120
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1111
feasibility_score: 8.7
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "7 weeks (Chat API integration → intent model → routing optimization → outcome tracking)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Chatbot platform variety; mitigation = build integrations for top 5.
  Business: Customer experience concerns; mitigation = conservative escalation thresholds.
  Operational: Requires continuous tuning; mitigation = automated feedback loops.
