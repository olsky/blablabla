title: Autonomous Enterprise Knowledge Decay Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Internal enterprise Confluence/Notion/SharePoint wikis suffer catastrophic "knowledge decay" — documentation referencing decommissioned systems, disbanded teams, or deprecated APIs that engineers still act on, causing outages. This system connects to corporate wikis via read/write APIs. An agent continuously reads pages, embeds them, and cross-references content against the live codebase (GitHub), HR org charts (Workday API), and infrastructure-as-code manifests (Terraform state). When it finds a page that references something no longer true, it automatically submits a targeted edit PR against the wiki with the correction, or archives it, attaching a structured justification.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 weeks. Semantic diffing between documentation and live system state across heterogeneous APIs is non-trivial. Requires careful embeddings and reference resolution.
  - Cash Out: Enterprise per-seat licensing.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise Engineering Org Clients: 20
  - Estimated Earnings: $200,000 ($833/seat/mo average)

  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (APIs for Confluence and GitHub are mature; the precise semantic cross-referencing logic is genuinely hard to make reliable.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium Risk: Auto-editing live documentation in regulated industries (banking, health) without a human approval gate could delete critical procedure docs. Must default to "propose" mode, not "commit" mode.
