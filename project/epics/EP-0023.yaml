title: Autonomous Legal Precedent Mining & Advisory Service
description: |
  **Idea:** An AI‑driven platform that continuously crawls public court databases, legal journals, and regulatory filings, extracting novel legal precedents and automatically generating advisory briefs for corporate legal teams. All research, summarization, and brief generation are performed by autonomous agents, with a subscription model for continuous updates.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months to build crawlers, NLP pipelines, and briefing agents.
  - Cash Out: Tiered SaaS pricing based on number of briefs per month. Break‑even expected at month 4.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Paying Companies: 120
  - Briefs Generated: 9,600
  - Estimated Earnings: $540,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Requires robust legal data pipelines and compliance with data use policies.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium Risk: Potential liability if advice is inaccurate; mitigated by disclaimer and human‑in‑the‑loop review for high‑risk briefs.
  - Low Risk: Technical complexity manageable with existing NLP models.
