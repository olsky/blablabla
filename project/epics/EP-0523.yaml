title: Autonomous B2B Software License Under-Utilization Miner
description: |
  **Idea:** Fortune 500 enterprises waste roughly $30 Billion annually on "abandonware"—SaaS seats (Salesforce, AWS, Github, Adobe) assigned to employees who left, changed roles, or simply don't use the tool. IT departments can't track it globally. This system is a read-only agent that integrates into Okta/Azure AD and the APIs of every major enterprise SaaS tool. It autonomously maps every employee to every provisioned license, correlates it against actual login frequency/usage data over 90 days, and instantly, programmatically revokes or downgrades unused licenses via the native APIs, reclaiming the cash instantly.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the definition of pure margin discovery. An enterprise installs the agent, and within 24 hours, their software operating expenses drop by 15-20% with zero impact on actual productivity and zero human IT tickets.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~1.5 months (Building integrations into the top 50 B2B SaaS APIs for provisioning/deprovisioning logic, building the Okta/AD mapping engine).
  - Cash Out: A pure gain-share model—10% of all proven, realized software license savings recovered.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Total Enterprise Waste Scanned: $5,000,000,000.
  - Total Waste Reclaimed: $1,000,000,000.
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000.

  **Feasibility Score:** 9.5/10 (API-driven user provisioning/de-provisioning (SCIM) is a completely standardized protocol across enterprise software).

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Accidental deactivation of critical "service accounts" (Requires rigorous heuristic tagging to differentiate humans from bots).
  - Medium: Gaining the initial read/write OAuth scopes from paranoid enterprise IT security teams.
  - Low: Market adoption (It is the easiest ROI pitch in B2B software).
