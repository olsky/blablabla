title: Autonomous Zero-Carbon Aviation Fuel (SAF) Verification Ledger
description: |
  **Idea:** Airlines claim they use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to hit ESG goals, but the supply chain is notoriously fraudulent (mixing standard jet fuel). This system integrates directly with physical flow-meters at refineries and airport hydrants. It algorithmically tracks the exact physical blend ratio of biofuel to kerosene. It mints an unbreakable cryptographic certificate via smart contract directly tied to a specific flight number, allowing airlines to mathematically prove their carbon reduction.

  **Why "WOW":** Eradicates greenwashing via cryptographic physics. An airtight, algorithmic audit trail for global aviation carbon.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (IoT flow-meter integrations at highly secure airport fuel depots, blockchain ledger deployment).
  - Cash Out: $500 verification fee per commercial flight certified.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Flights Certified: 300,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Physical tampering of the IoT flow meters by corrupt suppliers.
  - Medium: Complex integration with archaic airport refueling infrastructure.
  - Low: Airline Adoption (They must prove carbon neutrality by law in the EU).
