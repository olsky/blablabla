title: "Restaurant Food Waste Prediction & Inventory Optimization"
description: |
  ML system for quick-service and fine dining restaurants that predicts demand by
  daypart/weather/events and optimizes prep quantities to minimize waste while
  maintaining service levels. Predicts spoilage risk for inventory items. Integrates
  with POS systems (Square, Toast, Lightspeed) and supplier delivery APIs.
problem_statement: |
  U.S. restaurants throw away $162B+ annually (30-40% of food purchased). Waste is
  due to overpreparing (safety margin) for unpredictable demand. Labor costs are
  2nd largest expense; inefficient prep wastes both food and labor. Supply chain
  volatility (post-COVID) increased demand uncertainty.
solution:
  approach: |
    POS ingest (historical sales by item, time, daypart) + External signals (weather,
    local events, holidays) → Demand forecast (ML models per daypart/item) → Prep
    recommendation system considering storage capacity + shelf life + cost of waste
    vs. stockout → Inventory tracking agents → Spoilage alerts
  technical_stack:
    - Data: SQLI integration (Square, Toast, Lightspeed POS APIs), weather API, events API
    - ML: Demand forecasting (Prophet, gradient boosting), spoilage prediction
    - Agents: Prep recommendations, inventory monitoring, supplier optimization
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($500-2K/month per location) + % of waste reduction (10-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1400000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 350
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 333
feasibility_score: 8.9
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (POS integration → demand forecasting → prep recommendation engine → inventory agents)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: POS system fragmentation; mitigation = prioritize top 50% (Toast, Square).
  Business: High churn (restaurant closures); mitigation = simple pricing + quick payback.
  Operational: Staff adoption requires UX; mitigation = mobile app + voice alerts.
