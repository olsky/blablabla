title: "Commercial Real Estate Lease Renewal Optimization Engine"
description: |
  Agent that analyzes commercial real estate portfolios (office, retail, industrial)
  to predict lease expiration opportunities, benchmark market rates, and recommend
  renegotiation strategies. Levers tenant lease comps, corporate credit ratings,
  and local market data from CoStar, LoopNet APIs. Identifies 15-30% savings opportunities.
problem_statement: |
  $3T+ commercial real estate market; 60-70% of leases are renegotiated suboptimally.
  Tenants (corporations, retailers) lack leverage data; landlords exploit information
  asymmetry. Most CRE portfolio management is manual (spreadsheets); no automated
  monitoring of renewal opportunities.
solution:
  approach: |
    Portfolio ingestion (lease database) → Market benchmarking (CoStar, LoopNet) →
    Lease analysis (rate, terms, inflation) → Renegotiation impact modeling →
    Alerts + negotiation playbooks → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: CoStar API, LoopNet/Real Capital Analytics, CBRE comps feeds
    - ML: Market rate prediction, discounting models
    - Agents: Lease monitoring, benchmark alert, negotiation playbook generation
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-10K/month per portfolio) + 10-15% of negotiated savings (first year only)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2100000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 60
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2917
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (CoStar/LoopNet integration → lease extraction → benchmarking → recommendation engine)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: CRE data fragmentation; mitigation = standardize top 50% of buildings.
  Business: Requires client confidentiality (lease terms); mitigation = on-premise deployments.
  Market: Landlord resistance to tenant leverage data; mitigation = sell to both sides.
