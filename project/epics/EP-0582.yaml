title: Autonomous Gene Therapy Outcome Pricing Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** New gene therapies (like Zolgensma) cost $2M+ per dose, threatening to bankrupt healthcare systems. This platform establishes 'Value-Based Agreements' algorithmically. The hospital administers the $2M drug. The system then continuously ingests the patient's secure biomarker lab results over 5 years. If the patient's bloodwork shows the disease returning, the smart contract automatically claws back a fractional refund from the Pharma company's escrow and returns it to the insurer.

  **Why "WOW":** Forces pharmaceutical companies to put their money where their science is. Algorithmic money-back guarantees for human DNA editing.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Integrating strictly HIPAA-compliant biomarker lab APIs with financial escrow ledgers).
  - Cash Out: 2% administration fee on the billions of dollars held in these long-term outcome escrows.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Value of Therapies Escrowed: $5,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Pharma companies ferociously resisting any system that automatically claws back their booked revenue.
  - Medium: Patient privacy regarding continuous lab data streaming.
  - Low: Insurer demand (They refuse to pay $2M unconditionally anymore).
