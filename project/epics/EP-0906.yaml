title: Autonomous Import Duty & Tariff Minimization Engine
description: |
  Autonomously classifies Harmonized System (HS) codes for imported goods, calculates optimal tariff rates, and identifies trade agreement savings opportunities. The system ingests purchase orders + bill-of-materials from procurement systems (SAP, Coupa, Ariba), applies rules-based HS classification + LLM for ambiguous cases, cross-references against trade agreements (USMCA, GSP, EU), and calculates duty savings. Results feed directly into ERP and customs documentation workflows.

  **Why "WOW":** Addresses $7B annual gap in tariff overpayment. US–China tariffs remain at 20%+ through 2027; EU CBAM launches Q1 2026. Enterprises desperate for duty optimization with zero existing automation.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (HS classifier training, trade agreement logic, ERP integration)
  - Cash Out: 40% of duty savings identified and captured

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise importers: 1-3 pilots = $840k-$2.5M annual revenue per customer
  - Total portfolio: $95-130M (scaling to 20-30 importers by Year 2)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.2/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: 15-20% of HS codes are genuinely ambiguous; requires human broker escalation
  - Medium: CBP tariff enforcement changes; requires quarterly policy updates
  - Low: Market demand (enterprises bleeding money on tariffs; willingly share savings)
