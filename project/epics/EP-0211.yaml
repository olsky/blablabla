  first_year_projections:
    revenue: "$200,000,000"
    users: 10 major OEMs
feasibility_score: 9.0
risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "Accessing and normalizing data from disparate DMV and OEM databases is a significant challenge."
  market_risks: "Dealerships may be resistant to an automated system interfering with their existing scheduling processes."
  compliance_risks: "Must comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding the use of owner contact information."
