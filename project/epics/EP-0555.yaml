title: Predictive Wind Farm Yield Optimization & Trading
description: |
  **Idea:** Wind energy is highly intermittent, and grid operators penalize wind farms that underperform their hourly promises. This system utilizes LiDAR lasers mounted on the nacelle to detect wind gusts 30 seconds before they hit the blades. It simultaneously ingests regional atmospheric models. Armed with this sub-minute predictive edge, it algorithmically yawns/pitches the blades for maximum capture, while simultaneously trading the predicted energy delta on short-term grid spot markets.

  **Why "WOW":** Combines physical aerodynamic optimization with high-frequency energy trading in real-time.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (LiDAR ingestion, turbine SCADA integration, and API connection to grid markets).
  - Cash Out: Performance-based royalty on the increased MWh produced and traded.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Gigawatts Under Management: 15 GW
  - Estimated Revenue: $140,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Turbine manufacturers (Vestas/GE) voiding warranties if third-party software pitches the blades aggressively.
  - Medium: Latency in grid market trading execution.
  - Low: Renewable economics (Every extra megawatt produced goes straight to margin).
