title: "Airport Ground Operations Slot Optimization Engine"
description: |
  Real-time optimization system for airport gate scheduling, ground vehicle routing,
  and baggage handling. Minimizes gate conflicts, reduces aircraft turnaround time
  (currently 30-45 min, target <20 min), and optimizes ground crew allocation. Integrates
  with IATA standards and airport ODS (Operational Data Store).
problem_statement: |
  $50B+ annual cost in airport inefficiency; 30-40% of delays are ground operations
  related (gate conflicts, baggage delays, catering conflicts, crew positioning).
  Most airports use manual/legacy scheduling; no optimization. Slot delays compound
  across network (ripple effects on subsequent flights).
solution:
  approach: |
    Flight schedule ingest (FIDS systems) → Real-time telemetry (aircraft position,
    gate availability, crew location, baggage progress) → Conflict detection → Dynamic
    rescheduling → Ground operations orchestration (catering, cleaning, fueling) →
    Turnaround time optimization
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Airport ODS, ARCOS (airport systems), IATA messaging
    - Optimization: Constraint programming, graph algorithms
    - Real-time: Sensor/telemetry streams (WiFi, RFID vehicle tracking)
  revenue_model: "Revenue share on delay reductions (5-10% of delay cost savings) + annual platform fee ($50K-100K)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 25
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 5333
feasibility_score: 7.9
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "10 weeks (Airport ODS integration → conflict detection → optimization engine → real-time orchestration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legacy airport systems require custom integration; mitigation = plug-in architecture.
  Operational: Safety-critical; mitigation = extensive testing + dual control.
  Regulatory: IATA/FAA oversight of changes; mitigation = conservative rollout modes.
