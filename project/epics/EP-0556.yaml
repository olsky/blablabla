title: Automated B2B Debt Collection & Factoring Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** B2B companies write off billions in unpaid invoices because human lawyers are too expensive for small claims. This system acts as a relentless, polite, multi-modal LLM debt collector. It ingests unpaid invoices from the client's accounting software. It algorithmically factors (buys) the debt at a 20% discount. It then launches an automated, highly-tailored sequence of emails, SMS, and AI-voice calls directly to the debtor's accounts payable department, leveraging local contract law citations to force payment.

  **Why "WOW":** The ultimate algorithmic collections agency. It scales polite but legally-threatening persistence to infinity.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (Accounting platform APIs, LLM prompt engineering for legal persistence, automated dialers).
  - Cash Out: Collecting 100% of the invoice value after buying it algorithmically at an 80% discount.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Invoice Volume Factored & Collected: $1,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Aggressive consumer protection laws (e.g. FDCPA in the US) though B2B debt is usually less regulated.
  - Medium: LLM hallucinations making incorrect legal threats, causing liability.
  - Low: Corporate Demand (Everyone wants their money).
