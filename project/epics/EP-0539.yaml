title: Algorithmic Sports Betting Liquidity Provider (Non-consumer B2B)
description: |
  **Idea:** Sportsbooks struggle to balance their books dynamically during live games. This is a B2B algorithmic market-maker for sports betting. It ingests live computer vision data of player biomechanics, historical stats, and weather. It calculates hyper-accurate true probabilities in milliseconds. It then autonomously takes the other side of highly lopsided retail bets via API across major sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel), acting as the house's algorithmic risk absorber.

  **Why "WOW":** High-frequency market making brought to the massive global sports wagering market. Zero consumer marketing.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the sub-second probabilistic engine and API execution layers).
  - Cash Out: The mathematical house edge (Vig) captured over millions of micro-bets.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Wager Volume Cleared: $10,000,000,000\n  - Captured Edge: 1.5%
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Sportsbooks banning the agent for being too profitable (sharp money).
  - Medium: Latency in data streams causing stale pricing.
  - Low: Model accuracy (Given enough volume, statistics guarantees profit).
