title: Predictive Maintenance AI for EV Charging Hubs
description: An autonomous AI service that analyzes sensor data from charging stations to predict failures, schedule maintenance, and optimize uptime. Uses anomaly detection on vibration, temperature, and usage metrics to preempt issues, enabling operators to monetize through performance guarantees and data analytics subscriptions. Targets commercial fleets and public charging networks, leveraging big data from millions of charging events to reduce downtime by 40% and create new revenue streams from predictive insights sold to manufacturers.
