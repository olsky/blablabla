title: "Insurance Policy Lapse Prediction & Win-Back Engine"
description: |
  ML system for insurance carriers that predicts customers at risk of non-renewal/lapse,
  triggers win-back campaigns with personalized offers/messaging. Reduces policy lapse
  by 15-25%. Focuses on auto, home, life insurance. Integrates with insurance admin
  systems and customer data platforms.
problem_statement: |
  U.S. insurance carriers lose $50B+ annually to policy lapses/non-renewals. Lapse rates
  are 10-20% for auto (higher for minorities/lower income). Retention is cheaper than
  acquisition (3-5x). Most insurers use generic renewal notices; no personalization.
solution:
  approach: |
    Policy data ingest (renewal dates, claim history, payment history, coverage gaps) →
    Lapse risk scoring → Customer segmentation (by risk profile, motivation) → Personalized
    win-back campaign orchestration (email, SMS, phone with targeted offers) → Outcome
    tracking (renewal/lapse, premium elasticity)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Insurance admin system APIs, customer data platforms, postal/phone databases
    - ML: Churn prediction (gradient boosting), customer segmentation, offer personalization
    - Agents: Campaign orchestration, offer optimization, retention tracking
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($3K-10K/month) + % of retained premium (2-5% revenue share)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2200000

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Admin system integration → lapse prediction → campaign orchestration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Fair Lending Act (pricing discrimination); mitigation = offer validation + compliance team.
  Data: Privacy regulations (CCPA); mitigation = opt-in + data minimization.
  Adoption: Retention teams skeptical of automation; mitigation = pilot + performance proof.
