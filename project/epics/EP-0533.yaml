title: Zero-Knowledge Consumer Credit Scoring Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Legacy credit scores (FICO) are racist, archaic, and rely on centralized data honey-pots (Equifax). This system issues a Zero-Knowledge Proof agent to a user's local phone. It securely parses their banking app history, utility bills, and SMS receipts physically on-device, generating a mathematically rigorous credit risk score. It outputs only a cryptographic "True/False" on whether they meet a loan threshold back to a bank API, revealing zero PII.

  **Why "WOW":** Unlocks credit for billions of unbanked globally while guaranteeing absolute, mathematically provable privacy. Decentralized lending.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the mobile ZK-SNARK circuits and local parsing models).
  - Cash Out: API call ($2 per ZK proof verified) charged to the lending bank.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Proofs Verified: 75,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Banks trusting a decentralized, zero-knowledge algorithm over established FICO.
  - Medium: On-device parsing breaking due to OS updates.
  - Low: Consumer adoption (They retain total data control).
