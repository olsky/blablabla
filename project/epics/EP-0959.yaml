title: "Logistics Route & Load Optimization for 3PLs"
description: |
  Real-time optimization engine for third-party logistics (3PLs) that optimizes truck
  loads, routes, and drop sequence to minimize fuel costs and delivery time. Handles
  constraints (vehicle capacity, delivery windows, regulations). Reduces logistics costs
  by 20-30% and improves on-time delivery 40-60%.
problem_statement: |
  Logistics costs account for 8-12% of GDP ($1.6T+ annually in U.S.). Routing/load
  optimization is handled primarily by manual planning; computational optimization is
  underutilized except at mega-carriers. 3PLs lack margin to invest in tech; left with
  legacy software.
solution:
  approach: |
    Order ingest (weight, dimensions, pickup/delivery locations/windows) + Vehicle
    inventory + Traffic/weather data → Constraint optimization (capacity, time windows,
    regulations, cost) → Route generation (traveling salesman variants) → Load assignment
    → Real-time adjustments for new orders
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Order management systems, vehicle telemetry, traffic APIs, weather
    - Optimization: Constraint programming, genetic algorithms, heuristics
    - Real-time: Streaming order processing, live route updates
  revenue_model: "SaaS per 3PL ($2K-10K/month) + % of cost savings (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2800000
  roi_time_in_months: 0.9
  target_users_estimate: 95
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2456
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Order system integration → optimization engine → load planning → real-time updates)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Optimization performance at scale; mitigation = pre-computed heuristics for speed.
  Business: 3PLs cost-sensitive; mitigation = rapid payback (days to weeks).
  Operational: Driver autonomy concerns; mitigation = recommendations vs. mandates.
