title: "Mortgage Underwriting Fraud Detection Engine"
description: |
  ML system for mortgage lenders that detects fraud (income misrepresentation, asset fraud,
  appraisal manipulation, application falsification) in mortgage applications. Analyzes bank
  statements, tax returns, property appraisals, and credit reports. Blocks 95%+ fraud while
  maintaining <5% false positive rate.
problem_statement: |
  $2T+ annual U.S. mortgage market; mortgage fraud costs lenders $5-10B annually
  (undetected losses). Manual fraud review is labor-intensive; most fraud goes
  undetected until default or foreclosure. Post-2008 regulations require better fraud detection.
solution:
  approach: |
    Loan application data ingest → Multiple source validation (bank statements, tax
    returns, credit bureaus, property records, appraisal comps) → Inconsistency detection
    → Income verification model → Appraisal validation → Fraud risk scoring
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Bank APIs, IRS transcript data, credit bureaus, property records, appraisals
    - ML: Inconsistency detection, fraud risk scoring (gradient boosting)
    - Integration: Loan origination systems (LOS)
  revenue_model: "Per-loan fee ($50-150) + monthly SaaS for platform access"

risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Fair Lending compliance (no discrimination); mitigation = algorithmic audits.
  Operational: Lender workflow integration complexity; mitigation = white-glove onboarding.
  Regulatory: Mortgage lending is heavily regulated; mitigation = compliance team required.
