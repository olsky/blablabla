title: "Manufacturing Predictive Quality Defect Engine"
description: |
  AI system that predicts product defects 5-7 days before they occur by analyzing
  production sensor data, material properties, equipment logs, and historical
  defect patterns. Alerts operators to intervene before defects reach customers.
  Integrates with industrial IoT platforms (Siemens, ABB, GE Predix) via OPC-UA.
problem_statement: |
  Manufacturing defects cost enterprises $15B+ annually (rework, recalls, warranty).
  Most quality control is reactive (detect after production) or manual. Advanced
  manufacturers invest $10M+ in sensor infrastructure; most data goes unused.
  Predictive maintenance exists for equipment; predictive quality doesn't at scale.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest sensor streams (temperature, vibration, material properties) → Feature
    engineering (anomaly patterns) → Gradient boosting defect prediction → Alert
    engine with intervention recommendations
  technical_stack:
    - Data: OPC-UA servers, Siemens PLC data, sensor streams (Kafka)
    - ML: Gradient boosting (XGBoost), time series anomaly detection
    - Integration: Historian databases (Wonderware, InfluxDB)
  revenue_model: "Fixed SaaS ($2K-8K/month) + 8-12% of rework savings"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2400000

  target_users_estimate: 75
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2667
feasibility_score: 8.7
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (OPC-UA integration → sensor data pipeline → feature engineering → ML model)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Proprietary sensor protocols; mitigation = target top 80% (Siemens, ABB).
  Business: Requires on-site deployment in manufacturing; mitigation = edge compute model.
  Operational: False positives disrupt production; mitigation = high confidence threshold.
