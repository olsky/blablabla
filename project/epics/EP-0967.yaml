title: "Scientific Research Lab Efficiency & Instrument Utilization Optimizer"
description: |
  ML system for research institutions and pharma labs that optimizes experiment scheduling
  and instrument utilization. Predicts equipment downtime, recommends preventive maintenance,
  and optimizes experiment sequencing to maximize throughput. Increases lab productivity
  by 30-40% and equipment ROI by 50%+.
problem_statement: |
  Pharma/biotech R&D budgets exceed $200B globally; lab inefficiency costs 20-30% of
  research productivity. Expensive instruments (genomics sequencers, electron microscopes,
  LC-MS) sit idle 40-60% of time. Maintenance is reactive; unplanned downtime delays
  critical experiments. Experiment scheduling is manual.
solution:
  approach: |
    Lab data ingest (instrument usage logs, experiment queue, technician schedules,
    maintenance history) → Utilization pattern analysis → Equipment failure prediction →
    Experiment scheduling optimization (considering sample prep, instrument availability,
    technician skills) → Team communication orchestration
  technical_stack:
    - Data: LIMS (Lab Information Management Systems), instrument APIs, maintenance databases
    - ML: Equipment failure prediction, scheduling optimization
    - Agents: Maintenance alerts, scheduling recommendations, team notifications
  revenue_model: "SaaS per lab ($5K-15K/month) + % of productivity gains (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1400000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.5
  target_users_estimate: 40
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2917
feasibility_score: 8.2
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (LIMS integration → utilization analysis → failure prediction → scheduling optimizer)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: LIMS system variety; mitigation = support top 5 (LabWare, Avantor, Benchling).
  Adoption: Scientists care about science not efficiency; mitigation = position as research accelerant.
  Data: Lab protocols proprietary; mitigation = de-identified analysis + confidentiality agreements.
