title: "Poultry Genetics & Breeding Performance Matchmaker"
description: |
  Agent-driven platform analyzing genetic lineage databases, performance histograms
  (growth, feed conversion, immune response), and environmental interactions to match
  breeder flocks with broiler crosses. Predicts progeny performance and recommends
  selective breeding strategies to breeders and integrators.
problem_statement: |
  Poultry genetics research and selection is data-rich but underutilized. Breeders
  have decades of pedigree and performance data; integrators have flock outcome data.
  No unified intelligence layer connects them. Suboptimal genetic selections cost
  integrators $100M+ annually in missed performance gains. Each 1% gain in feed
  conversion or growth rate = $50-100M industry value.
solution:
  approach: |
    Build probabilistic models of genetic traits (growth rate, feed conversion,
    disease resistance, egg weight) from breeder databases. Agents ingest integrator
    flock results and production environment metadata (climate, feed, stocking
    density) to predict progeny performance. Recommend specific genetic lines to
    maximize traits for each customer's production scenario.
  technical_stack: |
    Genetic databases (pedigree APIs from major breeders: Aviagen, Cobb, Hubbard),
    flock performance datasets (integrator ERP/MIS systems), statistical modeling
    (Bayesian networks), recommendation engine.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per breeding company or integrator ($10K-50K/month) + referral/placement
    fees from breeders on recommended selections.
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.4
  target_users_estimate: 18
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 12037
feasibility_score: 8.1
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 10 weeks. Full: 15 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Access to proprietary genetic data; mitigation: partner with major
  breeders early, offer data licensing revenue. Business: Breeding science is
  conservative; mitigation: publish early results in veterinary journals.
