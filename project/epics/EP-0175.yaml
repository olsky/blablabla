title: "Autonomous Tug, Pilotage & Mooring Service Capacity & Routing Optimizer"
description: |
  **Idea:** Every port call requires a choreography of **tugs, pilots, and mooring gangs**. These services are supplied by a mix of port-owned, private, and cooperative providers. Dispatching is often done via phone and radio, based on planner intuition. Result: idle tugs, crews on overtime, missed windows when one constrained asset is in the wrong place, and under-utilized capacity across nearby ports.

  This optimizer ingests:
  - Vessel schedules and port-call lineups (ETA/ETD, LOA, beam, draft, maneuver complexity)
  - Tug, pilot, and mooring asset positions, capabilities, and crew rosters
  - Safety and operating constraints (weather, currents, max towage loads, crew rest rules)
  - Contractual tariffs and SLA terms with terminals and carriers

  Agents then:
  - Predict service demand per time block across a port or port cluster
  - Generate optimal assignment and routing plans for tugs, pilots, and mooring gangs
  - Dynamically re-optimize as delays, weather, or cancellations occur
  - Surface premium options (guaranteed-time escort, green-corridor support) at higher tariffs

  **Why "WOW":** Tug and pilotage companies leave money on the table via suboptimal asset use and lost opportunities to sell reliability as a premium. Terminals and carriers suffer when under-resourced windows cause missed berths. An autonomous optimizer increases moves per asset, cuts overtime, and enables **chargeable premium services**.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~10 months (demand forecasting, constraint-based routing engine, integrations to dispatch systems)
  - Cash Out: Efficiency gains and premium-service revenue share from the first service cluster.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Port Clusters Onboarded: 6
  - Annual Port Calls Covered: 160,000
  - Average Towage + Pilotage Revenue per Call: $18,000
  - Revenue Under Optimization: $2,880,000,000
  - Yield Uplift via Better Utilization & Premium Offers (5%): $144,000,000
  - Platform Share: 55%
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $79,200,000**

  With mid-year expansion to 10 clusters (≈260,000 calls), earnings exceed **$128M**.

  **Scaled First Year Projection:**
  - Revenue Under Optimization: $4,680,000,000
  - Uplift (5%): $234,000,000
  - Platform Share (55%): **$128,700,000**

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.3/10 — Dispatch optimization and crew-rostering problems are classic OR domains. AIS and local dispatch systems already track key events.

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Safety culture concerns about algorithmic dispatch; mitigated by embedding conservative safety rules and human override
  - Low: Data availability; providers already operate digital logs or dispatch software

  **Legal & Ethical:** Keeps all safety and rest regulations as hard constraints. Optimizes within, not around, those rules. Improves crew welfare by reducing unpredictable overtime.
