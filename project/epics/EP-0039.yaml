title: Autonomous "Adaptive-UI" Accessibility Enforcement Proxy
description: |
  **Idea:** A real-time, middle-ware proxy service that intercepts web application traffic and dynamically rewrites the DOM/CSS to ensure 100% WCAG compliance and personalized accessibility. The system's agents use visual-LLMs to describe unlabelled images, fix broken tab-indices, and adjust color-contrast ratios on the fly based on the specific user's accessibility profile (e.g., neuro-divergent focus-modes, low-vision optimization). This allows enterprises to achieve "Instant Compliance" without modifying their legacy codebase.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (Developing the real-time DOM-mutation engine + visual-LLM context caching).
  - Cash Out: Monthly subscription per domain/user ($1,000 - $50,000 for large enterprises).
  
  **Projections:**
  - First-Year Earnings: $1,100,000 (Huge demand due to increasing accessibility litigation).
  - First-Year Users: 300 Enterprise Customers.
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10 (Proxy technologies are standard; AI-driven DOM repair is the high-value layer).
  
  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Performance latency introduced by real-time rewriting.
  - Low: Technical complexity of DOM mutation.
