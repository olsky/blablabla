title: Autonomous Lithography Equipment Telemetry & Predictive Maintenance Oracle
description: A predictive maintenance network that ingests high-frequency telemetry from ASML EUV/DUV lithography machines to predict component failures (e.g., laser degradation, mirror misalignment) and automatically schedule maintenance during planned downtime, avoiding $100k/hour unplanned outages.

    users: 20 Enterprise Fabs
feasibility_score: 8.0
risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "High-frequency telemetry ingestion from ASML machines can be complex and require custom adapters."
  market_risks: "Fabs are highly protective of their equipment data and may resist cloud-based solutions, requiring on-premise deployments."
  compliance_risks: "Must adhere to strict data security and IP protection standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2)."
legal_ethical_considerations:
  - "Ensure all data processing complies with fab IP protection agreements."
  - "Implement robust access controls and audit logging to prevent unauthorized access to equipment data."
