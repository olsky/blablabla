title: Autonomous Enterprise Tech-Debt Actuarial & Auto-Refactor Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Technical debt costs global enterprise $300B+ annually in wasted engineering hours, yet CFOs can't measure it. This system connects to a company's Git repositories, Jira/Linear instances, and CI/CD pipelines. It uses an actuarial model to assign a literal dollar cost to every module's "debt" (by measuring developer slowdowns, bug-cycle frequency, and incident MTTR traced back to specific files). Crucially, it doesn't just report: it deploys autonomous coding agents during weekends or off-hours to automatically draft safe structural refactors (e.g., untangling circular dependencies, migrating deprecated libraries, writing missing unit tests). It presents these as fully-tested Pull Requests for human review on Monday morning.

  **Why "WOW":** Instead of engineers complaining about "spaghetti code," the CFO sees a dashboard showing "Module X costs us $40k/month in drag." Then, the system auto-resolves 40% of the drag. It's a CFO-approved dev tool.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (Building the actuarial Git/Jira correlation model, AST parsing agents for safe refactoring, sandboxing).
  - Cash Out: Tiered SaaS + "Debt Resolved" hybrid pricing ($3,000-$20,000/month for Enterprise).

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise Customers: 400
  - Average Monthly Sub: $4,500
  - Estimated Earnings: $21,600,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Correlation analytics between Git and Jira are straightforward. The auto-refactoring relies on LLMs and ASTs, which are now highly capable at deterministic structure changes.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Earning developer trust to merge the auto-generated PRs; mitigated by the system ensuring 100% test coverage on its own PRs.
  - Low: Enterprise security over source code access; mitigated by SOC2 and on-prem deployment options.
