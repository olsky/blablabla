title: Autonomous Parametric Wildfire Insurance & Real-Time Payout Engine
description: An API-driven insurance product where coverage is triggered by a satellite-detected fire perimeter crossing a property line. The system ingests NASA FIRMS/VIIRS data, cross-references it with geocoded policy boundaries, and automatically triggers a pre-agreed payout via a smart contract. No claims adjuster needed.
