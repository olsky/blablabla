title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Credit-Score Restoration
description: |
  **Idea:** Millions of people have 'Repairable' credit scores stuck in legacy disputes. This AI agent ingests the user's credit report and finds the exact legal anomalies (e.g., a bill not properly noticed). It autonomously initiates the 'Advanced Legal Dispute' sequence via API. Once the score jumps, it automatically sells the 'New Credit Capacity' to banks as a pre-vetted customer lead.

  **Why "WOW":** It automates the entire $15B credit repair industry. It turns a manual consumer chore into a high-speed B2B profit engine for banks waiting for qualified leads.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the credit-report parsing engine and the automated legal-dispute logic).
  - Cash Out: $500 payout from banks for every successfully 'repaired' and qualified high-ticket loan applicant.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Users Successfully Repaired and Referred: 400,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Credit Bureaus (Equifax/Experian) banning the AI's API-driven dispute submission protocols.
  - Medium: The legal validity of automated disputes being lower than human-driven ones in certain courts.
  - Low: Consumer demand (Everyone wants a better credit score for free).
