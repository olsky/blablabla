title: Synthetic Image "Style-DNA" Defense Ledger
description: |
  **Idea:** Generative AI models (Midjourney/Stable Diffusion) are trained on the intellectual 'Style' of human artists without compensation. This AI agent analyzes a model's weights or output signatures to identify the 'Style-DNA' percentage of a specific artist. It then executes an autonomous 'Style-Royalty' demand against the model-creator or the enterprise user generating the images.

  **Why "WOW":** It monetizes 'The Vibe' of an artist. It provides the first mathematical proof of 'Style-Theft' and delivers a license-bridge between traditional artists and AI labs.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Building the Style-DNA attribution models and the AI-model probe bots).
  - Cash Out: $1.00 per 1,000 AI-images generated using the artist's style.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - AI-Images Analyzed: 5,000,000,000
  - Style-Matches Found: 150,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Legal systems not yet recognizing 'Style' (vs. specific works) as a copyrightable asset.
  - Medium: AI labs using 'Style-Mixing' to dilute the DNA-attribution below detectable levels.
  - Low: Massive ethics pushback (Artists are currently suing AI companies; they need this tool).
