title: "Poultry Co-Infection & Metabolic Disease Predictor"
description: |
  Agents ingest historical flock data (mortality patterns, condemnation reasons,
  feed intake, growth curves) to identify risk signatures for secondary infections
  (colibacillosis, viral co-infections) and metabolic diseases (ascites, fatty
  liver). Recommends prophylactic interventions and supplier notifications.
problem_statement: |
  Co-infections and metabolic diseases account for 8-15% of complex flock losses
  and are hard to predict. Flocks affected can lose 2-5% additional birds beyond
  primary disease, costing integrators $1-3M annually. Early identification enables
  targeted feed supplementation or antibiotic selection, reducing severity.
solution:
  approach: |
    Build machine learning models on historical condemnation data (post-mortem
    findings) correlated with flock parameters (age, feed, climate, genetics,
    vaccination timing). Train on 5000+ flock datasets to identify early markers
    (consumption drop, growth slowdown, mortality spike timing). Agents flag at-risk
    flocks and propose preventive feed additives or protocol changes.
  technical_stack: |
    Integrator flock databases, processing plant condemnation records (accessible
    via API), feature engineering on time-series growth/consumption, gradient
    boosting models (XGBoost), recommend engine.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per integrator ($5K-15K/month) + success share (8-12% of avoided loss value).

risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Data quality in legacy systems; mitigation: data standardization layer
  and validation scripts. Business: Liability around health claims; mitigation: frame
  as optimization aid, not diagnosis; require veterinary co-review.
