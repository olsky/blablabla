title: Autonomous Aircraft-Lease Collateral Monitor (IoT-based)
description: |
  **Idea:** Aircraft leasing is a $200B industry, but banks lose billions when an airline 'cannibalizes' parts from a leased jet. This AI monitors the live 'Maintenance Log' (telemetery) of the engines and flight hours via API. If a critical part is detected as being removed or the engine-health shifts unexpectedly, the AI autonomously issues a 'Collateral Breech' notice to the bank and notifies the FAA/regulatory API.

  **Why "WOW":** It provides 'Real-Time Visibility' into a billion-dollar physical asset at 35,000 feet. It makes aircraft-lease defaults 100% predictable.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the engine-telemetry anomaly detection and integrating with aircraft-maintenance ERPs).
  - Cash Out: Annual SaaS: $10k per aircraft under monitoring.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Commercial Aircraft Monitored: 15,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Airlines hacking the telemetry output to show 'False Health' while they cannibalize the jet.
  - Medium: Complexity of monitoring heterogeneous fleets (Boeing vs Airbus) across diverse international maintenance standards.
  - Low: Lender Demand (They are terrified of 'Zombie' aircraft that appear healthy on paper but are stripped of parts).
