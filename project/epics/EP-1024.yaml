title: "Breeder Flock Replacement Cycle Optimizer"
description: |
  Autonomous system analyzing breeder flock age profiles, genetic drift, and market
  demand to recommend optimal culling and replacement schedules. Agents predict
  future hatchling supply and genetics to match customer demand for specific poultry
  types (broilers, layers, turkeys).
problem_statement: |
  Breeder flock management is capital-intensive and multi-year commitment. Wrong
  replacement timing leads to either hatchling shortage (lost sales) or excess
  supply (depressed prices). Genetic drift from aging flocks degrades progeny
  performance. Current planning is reactive; no agent optimizes replacement cycles
  relative to market demand. A 5% improvement in supply-demand match = $100M+ value.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest breeder flock databases (age, genetics, health), hatchery demand
    forecasts, and multi-year market prices. Build optimization models predicting
    progeny performance declines with flock age. Agent recommends replacement timing
    and genetics selection to match forecasted demand and maximize margins.
  technical_stack: |
    Breeder flock MIS systems, demand forecasting (from integrators), multi-year
    financial modeling, genetic performance databases.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per breeding company ($15K-40K/month) + placement fees from customer matches.

risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Breeder data access; mitigation: partner with major breeders (Aviagen,
  Cobb, Hubbard) early. Business: Long-term decisions; mitigation: build trust
  through early wins on shorter planning cycles.
