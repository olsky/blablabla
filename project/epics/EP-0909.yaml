title: Autonomous Supply Chain ESG & Sustainability Compliance Agent
description: |
  Autonomously calculates Scope 3 emissions across supply chains, generates regulatory disclosures (CSRD/CBAM/TCFD), and flags non-compliant suppliers. The system connects to procurement platforms (Ariba, Coupa), queries supplier carbon data (CDP, SCI, SASB), ingests emissions factor databases (GHG Protocol, EPA), and calculates Scope 3 = supplier_emissions + transport_emissions per transaction. Auto-generates CSRD reports, CBAM carbon passports, and supplier scorecards.

  **Why "WOW":** Addresses $85B ESG compliance tax. CSRD compliance deadline = December 2025 (URGENT). CBAM carbon tariffs launch Q1 2026. Enterprises face $5M-$100M fines for non-compliance. Automation is existential, not optional.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Emissions DB normalization, procurement integration, report generation)
  - Cash Out: $250k-500k SaaS subscription per enterprise + 10% of emissions reduction cost savings

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise customers: 2-3 pilots = $350k ACV = $700k-$1.05M annual revenue
  - Total portfolio: $120-180M (scaling to 50 enterprises by Year 2)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.1/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Supplier data quality is poor; many lack published carbon footprints
  - Medium: Regulatory framework volatility (CSRD/CBAM rules still evolving)
  - Low: Customer demand (CFOs have board mandates; urgent compliance deadlines)
