title: Programmatic Bio-Informatics Drug Repurposing Dataset Generator
description: |
  **Idea:** A headless intelligence engine that cross-references FDA adverse event databases, public genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and open-source chemical property libraries (like PubChem). The system employs an LLM to automatically look for non-obvious correlations (e.g., heavily identifying that an off-patent blood pressure medication is showing statistically significant side-effects that correlate with inhibiting a specific protein found in a rare autoimmune disease). It generates these theoretical "Repurposing Candidate Packets" and sells them via an API ecosystem to mid-tier biotech research firms who lack massive internal data-science teams.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 weeks. Requires deep knowledge of bio-informatics data structures and API integrations with NCBI/PubChem.
  - Cash Out: Selling premium datasets.
  
  **First Year Projections:**
  - Biotech / Academic Subscriptions: 20
  - Estimated Earnings: $100,000
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (The data exists and is public; the value is entirely in the automated cross-referencing and statistical weighting).
  
  **Risk Analysis:** 
  - Medium Risk: The system produces hypotheses, not facts. Severe disclaimers must be embedded asserting this is mathematical data, not medical advice.
