title: Autonomous 'Legal-Entity-Identifier' (LEI) Automation Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Every institutional entity in global finance must have an LEI, but issuing/renewing them is a manual chore. This AI agent sits as a 'Registrar'. It autonomously pulls physical company register data, verifies beneficial ownership, mints the LEI, and submits it to the GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation) API in seconds.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns the foundation of institutional identity into a 100% autonomous background process. It becomes the 'Stripe for LEIs'.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2.5 months (GLEIF API integration and cross-register OCR/NLP verification).
  - Cash Out: $100 per renewal/at-issue call.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - LEI Transactions Processed: 1,500,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Gaining official LOU (Local Operating Unit) status from GLEIF which is a bureaucratic barrier.
  - Medium: Varying data-standards across disparate national corporate registers.
  - Low: Market Need (You cannot trade institutional finance without an active LEI; adoption is 100%).
