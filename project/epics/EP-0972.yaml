title: "B2B SaaS Churn Prediction & Upsell Automation"
description: |
  ML system for B2B SaaS companies that predicts customer churn risk at account and user level,
  identifies at-risk cohorts, and automatically recommends/executes upsell/cross-sale offers.
  Reduces churn by 10-20% and increases retention revenue by 25-40%.
problem_statement: |
  $300B+ enterprise SaaS market; median churn 5-7% monthly for SMB SaaS. Churn costs
  SaaS companies $100B+ annually (lost revenue + replacement costs). Most churn is
  preventable if caught 30-60 days before (engagement drops, usage decline).
solution:
  approach: |
    Product usage + billing data ingest → Engagement metric extraction → Churn risk
    scoring (gradient boosting) → Cohort identification → Upsell recommendation (by
    feature adoption gaps) → Automated outreach (email, in-app) → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Segment/Amplitude APIs, billing systems, usage databases
    - ML: Churn prediction, product-market fit scoring
    - Agents: Upsell automation, customer success alerts
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($3K-10K/month) +  revenue share (2-5% of retained MRR)"

feasibility_score: 9.0
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Analytics API integration → churn prediction → upsell automation)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: SaaS analytics fragmentation; mitigation = support Segment/Amplitude primarily.
  Business: Churn varies by vertical; mitigation = vertical-specific models.
  Adoption: CSM team resistance; mitigation = shows impact on retention metrics.
