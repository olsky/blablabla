title: Generative 'Corporate-Governance' Proxy-Voting Bot
description: |
  **Idea:** Institutions (Asset Managers) must vote on 10,000+ proxy-proposals (ESG, Board seats) every year. Humans can't read them all. This AI agent ingests the institution's 'Voting Policy' and every single 300-page proxy-statement. It autonomously generates the 'Recommended Vote' with 10-page justification and executes the vote via the Broadridge/ProxyEdge API.

  **Why "WOW":** It acts as a 'Collective Brain' for institutional governance. It ensures 100% alignment with fiduciary duty without a single human analyst needing to read a proxy-statement.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the fine-tuned legal-NLP for board-proxy analysis and integrating with voting APIs).
  - Cash Out: $5k/year per portfolio-account managed.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Institutional Accounts: 30,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A 'Black Swan' board-member scandal being missed by the AI but discovered by humans, leading to a fiduciary duty lawsuit against the asset manager.
  - Medium: Regulators (SEC) demanding a 'Human in the Loop' for every single vote.
  - Low: Cost Cutting (Asset managers are desperate to slash their proxy-research department costs).
