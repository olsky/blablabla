title: Autonomous Global ESG Scoring & Reporting Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Companies face mounting pressure to disclose ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) metrics, yet current solutions are fragmented, manual, and costly. This autonomous service ingests real-time data from satellite imagery, supply-chain disclosures, IoT sensors, and public filings. AI models compute comprehensive ESG scores, generate regulatory-compliant reports, and continuously monitor changes. The platform offers an API for investors, rating agencies, and corporations to retrieve up-to-date ESG data on demand.

  **Why "WOW":** Provides instant, auditable ESG scores, reducing reporting costs by 80% and enabling investors to reallocate $200B of capital toward high-scoring firms within seconds.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~13 months (data pipelines, AI model training, regulatory compliance, API infrastructure).
  - Cash Out: 2% subscription fee on total market cap of companies covered.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Companies Covered: 10,000 (average market cap $5B)
  - Total Market Cap Covered: $50,000,000,000
  - Subscription Revenue (2%): $1,000,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Data sources are abundant; regulatory frameworks for ESG reporting are solidifying.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Regulatory changes in ESG reporting standards.
  - Medium: Data quality inconsistencies across regions.
  - Low: Technical scalability – cloud-native architecture.
