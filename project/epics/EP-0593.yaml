title: Predictive Maintenance for Global Wind Turbine Gearboxes
description: |
  **Idea:** When a wind turbine gearbox shatters mid-air, it costs $500k to replace. This software ingests high-frequency acoustic data and vibration telemetry natively from the turbine casing. Using edge-AI audio analytics, it hears the microscopic grinding of a failing ball-bearing months before the heat sensor detects it. It algorithmically throttles the turbine's max RPM to prevent shattering and auto-orders the specific replacement part to the exact GPS coordinate.

  **Why "WOW":** Listening to machines algorithmically to predict their death. Saves millions in catastrophic mechanical failures.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Training audio-anomaly LLMs/transformers specifically on industrial rotational physics).
  - Cash Out: SaaS fee: $5,000/turbine/year.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Turbines Monitored: 25,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Background environmental noise (storms) causing false-positive acoustic triggers, wasting maintenance trips.
  - Medium: Deploying the heavy edge-compute models onto legacy, low-power turbine hardware.
  - Low: Utility adoption (Immediate capital preservation).
