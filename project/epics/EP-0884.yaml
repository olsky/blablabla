title: Autonomous 'Conflict-Mineral' Supply-Chain Auditor
description: |
  **Idea:** Consumer brands (Apple, Samsung) face massive scandals for using 'Conflict Minerals' from warzones. This AI agent monitors the satellite telemetry of industrial mines and the 'Chain-of-Custody' logbooks via local port APIs. it identifies minerals that 'Disappear and Reappear' in non-conflict countries and autonomously issues a 'Stop-Work' order to the brand's procurement API.

  **Why "WOW":** It serves as the 'Global Morality Guardian' for hardware. It provides mathematically-verifiable ethical assurance for multi-billion dollar brands.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Satellite mine-telemetry monitoring and the cross-border chain-of-custody ML).
  - Cash Out: SaaS Compliance Fee ($200k/year per major hardware brand).

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Global Brands Protected: 750
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Militias/Smugglers learning to 'spoof' the satellite-telemetry of mines via camouflage or signal jamming.
  - Medium: Complexity of monitoring heterogeneous mineral types (Tantalum, Tin, Tungsten, Gold).
  - Low: Brand Demand (ESG scandals drop stock prices by 10-20%; they will pay for this firewall).
