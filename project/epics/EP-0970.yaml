title: "Tax Return & Audit Risk Intelligence Engine"
description: |
  ML system for accountants and tax preparers that analyzes tax returns to identify high
  audit risk items and red flags BEFORE filing. Recommends documentation improvements
  and substantiation strategies. Reduces audit rates by 40-60% and audit burden by 70%+.
  Integrates with tax software (TurboTax, CCH Axcess, Thomson Reuters).
problem_statement: |
  IRS conducts 500K+ audits annually; businesses fear disproportionate audit targeting.
  CPAs prepare returns blindly (no audit risk assessment). 80% of tax disputes are
  documentation-related (preventable). Audit defense is expensive ($10K-$50K+).
solution:
  approach: |
    Tax return data ingest (income sources, deductions, credits, demographics) → IRS audit
    risk scoring (using ML trained on audit outcome data) → Red flag identification →
    Substantiation recommendations (what documentation strengthens each claim) → Filing
    optimization → Post-filing monitoring for statute of limitations
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Tax form data (1040, 1120, schedules), historical audit outcomes, IRS guidance
    - ML: Audit risk prediction (gradient boosting on audit patterns)
    - Integration: Tax software APIs, CPA workflow tools
  revenue_model: "SaaS per firm ($1K-5K/month) + per-return fees ($10-50)"

implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Tax software API integration → audit risk modeling → recommendations engine)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Tax advice restrictions (CPA licensing); mitigation = position as risk assessment tool not advice.
  Accuracy: IRS audit patterns change; mitigation = continuous model retraining with audit outcome feedback.
  Adoption: CPAs protective of autonomy; mitigation = augment (not replace) CPA judgment.
