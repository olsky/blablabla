title: Autonomous Regulatory Conflict Graph Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Multi-national SaaS companies face an ever-expanding, mutually contradictory web of data regulations (GDPR, CCPA, Brazil LGPD, India DPDP, China PIPL). A single feature — say, a user activity log — can simultaneously be legally required in one jurisdiction and legally prohibited in another. This system maintains a continuously-updating semantic knowledge graph of global regulations, cross-linked with product feature definitions extracted from engineering changelogs. When a new regulation is published or a product feature is committed, the agent autonomously runs a multi-jurisdictional conflict analysis and raises structured Jira/Linear tickets flagging the legal tension before the feature ships.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~10 weeks to build and seed the knowledge graph schema and integrate GitHub/Jira webhooks for event-driven conflict checking.
  - Cash Out: High-ticket Enterprise compliance SaaS subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enterprise SaaS Clients (Multi-national): 15
  - Estimated Earnings: $300,000 ($1,667/mo/client average)

  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (Knowledge graph construction and regulatory NLP parsing are solved problems independently; the combination and automatic conflict-detection logic is the hard, novel part.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High Stakes Risk: If the engine misses a conflict, the client ships an illegal feature. The system must be positioned as an advisory layer, never a legal opinion, with clear TOC liability disclaimers.
