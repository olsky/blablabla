title: Autonomous Wage & Hour Compliance Monitoring & Prevention Engine
description: 'Wage & Hour violations cost US employers $3–5B/year in fines. Companies face lawsuits (class actions $50M+), state penalties, reputational damage. Current compliance manual + reactive. This AI system scans payroll + timekeeping real-time (ADP, Workday, Gusto, Kronos), flags violations before payment (unpaid OT, missed breaks, misclassification, wage theft), applies FLSA + state-specific rules, generates audit logs (defensible in litigation), recommends fixes (auto-correct payroll before check cuts). Result company avoids $500K–$5M/year in fines/lawsuits; saves 3–5 FTE compliance work.'

value_proposition: Monitor wage & hour compliance continuously. Detect violations before payment. Reduce litigation/fine risk 90%. Automate audit defense. Ensure legal payroll across multi-state, multi-system operations. Avoid $500K–$5M fines/lawsuits annually.

target_customer: Enterprises 1,000+ employees across multiple states; hospitality chains (wage theft trend); retail (shift labor compliance); healthcare (overtime complexity); manufacturing (prevailing wage rules); staffing firms (contractor misclassification).

business_case:
  problem_statement: 'Wage compliance nightmare: Fines $10K–$50K per violation; class-action settlements $5M–$500M (Starbucks, Chipotle, Amazon). Violations unpaid OT (most common), missed breaks, misclassification, wage theft, tip pooling. 50 states × federal FLSA = 2,500+ rules; systems don't cross-check. Current detection 1–2x/year manual audits (massive blindspot). Company with 50K employees, 1M+ timekeeping records/month = impossible to audit manually. Why AI needed scale (1M records/month); timing (prevent violation before payment); rule automation.'
  
  solution_approach: '1) Data ingest (ADP, Workday, Gusto, Kronos, timekeeping badges/apps). 2) Rule engine (implement FLSA + state rules as executable code: OT >40/week, break compliance per state <4 hours (CA) or <6 hours (NY), misclassification test, wage floor). 3) Scoring confidence. 4) Auto-correction (clear violations like unpaid OT). 5) Escalation (misclassification alerts HR). 6) Audit trail (log every check, every violation, every action—defensible in court).'
  
  target_metrics: 'Compliance rate >99% employees paid legally (vs. 85–95%). Violation detection <1 per 10K records. Cost avoidance $500K–$5M/year per customer. Time savings HR <1 FTE compliance (vs. 3–5 currently).'
  
  assumptions: Modern payroll system has API. Customer shares payroll data with encryption. Compliance rules codifiable (DOL publishes). Real-time correction feasible (24-hour delay acceptable).
  
  revenue_model: 'SaaS tiered by employee count: Small 100–500 employees $1K/mo ($12K/yr); Mid 500–5K employees $5K/mo ($60K/yr); Enterprise 5K+ employees $15K–$25K/mo ($180K–$300K/yr). OR success-based % of fines/lawsuits avoided (difficult attribution). Recommended Model 1 (SaaS tiered).'
  
  product_roadmap: 'Phase 1 Weeks 1–8: MVP rule engine (payroll data pipeline weeks 1–2, FLSA + top-3 state rules weeks 3–4, scoring+alerting weeks 5–6, testing weeks 7–8). Phase 2 Weeks 9–12: Auto-correction + expansion (weeks 9–10 auto-correct workflow, weeks 11–12 expand states + industry rules). Phase 3 Months 4–6: Audit defense + LE integration.'
  
  feasibility_score_narrative: 'High technical: Compliance rules deterministic; payroll data structured; APIs available. No novel ML needed. Business medium risk (requires close integration; privacy/legal agreements). Data sensitive (HIPAA-like security + data residency required).'
  
  deployment_model: 'Option 1 SaaS (we host, company provides API creds). Option 2 on-premise (customer deploys in VPC). Recommended SaaS + mega-enterprises on-premise option.'
  
  success_criteria: 'Acquire 20–50 mid-market companies Year 1. Compliance accuracy >99%. False positive <2%. NPS >70. Retention >90%. Avoid $5M–$20M fines per customer.'

  user_segment_distribution: 'Large enterprises 5K+ employees 15–25 @ $20K/mo = $3.6M–$6M. Mid-market 500–5K employees 50–80 @ $5K/mo = $3M–$4.8M. Staffing/hospitality (high violation) 20–40 @ $2K/mo = $480K–$960K. Conservative 40 companies @ $100K avg = $4M. Realistic 80 companies @ $97.5K = $7.8M. Optimistic 120 @ $85K = $10.2M.'
  
  revenue_trajectory: 'Month 1–2 MVP; Month 3 first pilot $5K/mo; Month 4 pilot shows 50+ detected violations, converts to $800K–$1M annual; Month 5–6 2–3 more customers ($50K–$80K/mo); Month 7–9 30–40 customers ($300K–$400K/mo ARR); Month 10–12 60–80 customers ($600K–$800K/mo ARR).'

  implementation_timeline: 'Weeks 1–8 MVP rule engine. Weeks 9–12 auto-correction + states. Month 4–5 pilot + sales. Month 6–12 scale 10–20 customers/mo.'
  
  dependencies: Payroll system API access. Compliance legal review. Customer willingness share payroll data.

feasibility_score: 8.8

risk_analysis: 'Technical (API reliability, data quality errors; mitigation lag tolerance, high thresholds). Business (privacy concern, false positive loss trust; mitigation on-premise option, SOC 2). Market (large enterprises have teams; mitigation focus mid-market 500–5K). Legal (company ignores flagging gets sued liability; mitigation TOS advisory, no warranty).'
