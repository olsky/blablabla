title: "Preventive Maintenance Optimization for Industrial Equipment"
description: |
  ML system that optimizes preventive maintenance schedules for industrial equipment
  (pumps, motors, compressors, bearings) by predicting remaining useful life (RUL)
  and optimal maintenance windows. Reduces unplanned downtime by 60-75% and maintenance
  costs by 30-40%. Integrates with CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems).
problem_statement: |
  Industrial downtime costs manufacturers $50B+ annually. 40-60% of maintenance is
  reactive (emergency repairs); preventive maintenance is schedule-based (inefficient).
  Equipment RUL prediction doesn't exist at scale; most companies over-maintain.
solution:
  approach: |
    Equipment telemetry ingest (vibration, temperature, pressure, electrical signature
    analysis) → Prognostics algorithm (bearing wear progression, motor degradation patterns) →
    RUL prediction → Optimal maintenance window recommendation → Spare parts planning
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Industrial IoT sensors, CMMS APIs (SAP PM, Maximo)
    - ML: RUL prediction (neural networks, survival analysis)
    - Agents: Maintenance scheduling, spare parts optimization, cost-benefit analysis
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($3K-15K/month) + % of avoided downtime costs (5-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2700000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 75
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3600
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Sensor integration → RUL modeling → CMMS integration → scheduling optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legacy equipment without sensors; mitigation = retrofit IoT sensors.
  Operational: Conservative maintenance culture; mitigation = start with monitoring-only mode.
  Implementation: Requires domain expertise in equipment types; mitigation = hire experienced engineer.
