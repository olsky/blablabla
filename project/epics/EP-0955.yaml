title: "Supply Chain Visibility & Demand Sensing Engine"
description: |
  Real-time supply chain visibility platform that aggregates data from suppliers,
  distributors, and logistics partners to forecast demand disruptions 4-8 weeks ahead.
  Predicts stockouts and triggers early procurement. Integrates with ERP (SAP, Oracle),
  supplier EDI systems, and logistics platforms.
problem_statement: |
  $100B+ lost annually to supply chain inefficiencies (stockouts, overstocking, bullwhip
  effect). Most companies have zero visibility beyond tier-1 suppliers. Demand sensing
  is manual (sales forecasts are often wrong); supply chain reaction is reactive.
solution:
  approach: |
    Data orchestration: POS data (actual demand), inventory levels, supplier leadtimes, 
    transit times → Demand sensing (signal processing, outlier detection) → Supply
    network simulation → Intervention recommendations (expedite orders, switch suppliers,
    adjust demand) → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: ERP APIs, EDI systems, IoT tracking (RFID/GPS), POS feeds, carrier APIs
    - ML: Demand sensing (signal decomposition), supply network optimization
    - Agents: Alert generation, procurement recommendations, supplier negotiation support
  revenue_model: "SaaS per supply chain ($5K-30K/month) + value share on avoided stockouts (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 3200000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.0
  target_users_estimate: 55
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 4848
feasibility_score: 8.4
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (ERP/EDI integration → demand sensing → supply network modeling → optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Integration across heterogeneous systems; mitigation = API-first architecture.
  Business: Requires supplier data sharing; mitigation = aggregate/anonymized insights.
  Operational: Procurement teams slow to adopt; mitigation = pilot with enlightened suppliers.
