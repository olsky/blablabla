title: Autonomous Scientific Citation Bounty Hunter
description: |
  **Idea:** Commercial whitepapers and R&D presentations often cite specific scientific findings or use patent-pending diagrams without formal license or proper citation back to the original funding institution. This AI agent monitors global commercial R&D firehoses. It identifies 'Plagiarized Knowledge' and autonomously files for a 'Knowledge Usage Fee' on behalf of universities and labs.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns 'Invisible Research' into a high-margin revenue source for cash-strapped universities. It identifies the exact ROI of a research paper in the private sector.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the scientific-document semantic matcher and the global R&D crawler).
  - Cash Out: $5k flat-fee per commercial citation found + 10% of any derived product patent royalties.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Commercial Whitepapers Scanned: 10,000,000
  - Shadow-Citations Found: 40,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Private companies hiding their R&D whitepapers behind increasingly restrictive paywalls/NDA.
  - Medium: Differentiating between 'General Scientific Knowledge' and 'Specific Proprietary Findings'.
  - Low: Institutional Demand (Universities are desperate for non-grant-based revenue).
