title: AI-Directed Mining Fleet Dispatch Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Global open-pit mines operate fleets of massive $5M autonomous dump trucks. However, dispatching them to the correct shovel to maintain perfect ore-grade blends at the processing plant is incredibly complex. This system sits above the fleet. It ingests laser-scanned geology data, real-time mill chemistry constraints, and truck telemetry. It completely algorithmically dictates the sub-second routing of every truck in the mine to perfectly balance the chemical feed going into the multi-billion dollar refinery.

  **Why "WOW":** Algorithmically controls physical fleets weighing thousands of tons to optimize chemical extraction equations. Pure industrial robotics orchestration.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Deep integration into proprietary mining comms networks like Rajant and OEM APIs like Cat MineStar).
  - Cash Out: Massive SaaS license ($5M/yr per Tier-1 mine site) plus a fraction of increased mineral yield.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Tier-1 Mines Under Full Orchestration: 25
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Lethal danger of algorithmic errors routing 400-ton autonomous vehicles in a crowded physical space.
  - Medium: OEMs resisting third-party software controlling their hardware.
  - Low: Mining company budget (A 1% yield increase is worth tens of millions per year).
