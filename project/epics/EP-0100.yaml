title: Autonomous E-Commerce Chargeback Representation Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** E-commerce merchants lose over $100 Billion annually to "friendly fraud" (chargebacks where the customer actually received the item but claimed they didn't). Fighting these disputes is highly manual, requiring staff to gather tracking numbers, IP logs, and past purchase history into a PDF evidence packet. This system plugs directly into Stripe, Shopify, and FedEx/UPS via API. When a chargeback is initiated, it autonomously pulls all relevant transaction data, geolocation tags, device fingerprints, and delivery proofs, uses an LLM to generate a compelling, bank-compliant "Representation Letter", and submits it back through the payment gateway API within minutes.

  **Why "WOW":** Merchants win less than 30% of chargebacks manually because they miss deadlines or submit incomplete evidence. This system raises win rates to 75%+ with zero human effort. It literally prints recovered money for the merchant.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months (Payment gateway integrations, logistics APIs, LLM document generator tuned on bank-specific formats).
  - Cash Out: $99/mo base SaaS + 10% success fee on successfully recovered funds.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Active Merchants: 4,000
  - Average Recovered per Merchant/Mo: $4,000
  - Estimated Earnings (Base + Success): $23,952,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10 (APIs for Shopify, Stripe, and major carriers are robust. The dispute submission endpoint is standard across major payment processors.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Payment processor API rate limits and Webhook latency during holiday spikes.
  - Medium: Evolving evidence requirements from Visa/Mastercard (Requires continuous template updates).
  - Low: Technical execution is straightforward data collation and templating.
