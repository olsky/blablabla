title: "Commercial Software License Optimization Engine"
description: |
  ML agent that analyzes software license usage patterns across enterprises using
  system telemetry, logs, and billing data. Identifies underutilized licenses,
  consolidation opportunities, and negotiates volume discounts. Integrates with
  Flexera, IBM License Optimization, and cloud cost platforms. Saves $100K-$5M annually.
problem_statement: |
  Enterprises waste $20B+ annually on unused or redundant software licenses. License
  management is fragmented across business units; no centralized optimization. True
  utilization patterns require cross-system visibility (on-premise + cloud + SaaS).
  Vendor negotiations lack data ammunition.
solution:
  approach: |
    Telemetry aggregation (Windows, Mac, Linux system logs) → License usage inference →
    Cost allocation by department/cost center → Benchmarking (industry averages) →
    Consolidation recommendations → Vendor negotiation playbooks + ROI models
  technical_stack:
    - Data: System telemetry (WMI, SNMP), cloud API usage logs, vendor billing APIs
    - ML: Usage pattern clustering, cost optimization
    - Agents: License audit automation, benchmarking, negotiation scoring
  revenue_model: "% of recovered savings (10-15% first year, then 5% ongoing) + platform fees ($3K-15K/yr)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1900000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 45
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3519
feasibility_score: 8.5
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Telemetry collection → usage inference → benchmarking engine → negotiation tools)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: System telemetry variability across enterprise; mitigation = modular data collectors.
  Business: License vendors resist transparency; mitigation = position as customer retention tool.
  Privacy: Employee activity monitoring concerns; mitigation = aggregate-only + no user tracking.
