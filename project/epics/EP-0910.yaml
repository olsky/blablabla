title: Autonomous Telecom Billing Dispute Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Fortune 500 companies lose $2–5M annually to systematic telecom billing errors (hidden fees, tier misapplication, duplicate charges). Current solution: hire billing auditors ($200K+ annually). This autonomous system ingests monthly telecom bills (PDF → LLM extraction), cross-references against service agreements (NLP parsing), flags overcharges via anomaly detection, and auto-generates 40-page legal dispute documents with contractual and regulatory references. System submits disputes to carriers via email/API, recovers errors, and takes 15% commission on recovered funds.
  
  **Why "WOW":** IT managers have no visibility into buried overcharges. System recovers money they didn't even know was lost, from day 1.

value_proposition: |
  Recover 8–12% of enterprise telecom spending that is systematically overcharged due to billing errors. Completely automated dispute generation and submission. No human billing auditor required.

target_customer: |
  Fortune 500 companies with $10M–$500M annual telecom spend. Global enterprises with 50–500 office locations requiring consolidated telecom cost management across multiple carriers.

business_case:
  problem_statement: |
    Enterprise telecom bills are intentionally complex (20–500 page invoices). Carriers systematically over-bill via hidden fees, tier misapplication, and delayed credits. Businesses cannot manually audit at scale; disputes require legal language and historical proof. Current "solution" is expensive billing auditors ($200–400K annually) who only cover large invoices. 40% of telecom bills contain errors; average overpayment is 8–12% ($800K–$1.2M for a $10M/year customer).
  
  solution_approach: |
    1. Bill ingestion: Customers forward PDF bills or grant cloud portal access
    2. LLM extraction: Parse line items, billing terms, promotional codes
    3. Contract ingestion: Customers upload service agreements (SLAs, promotional terms)
    4. Dynamic matching: LLM cross-reference (is this charge contractually justified?)
    5. Anomaly detection: Flag charges appearing <3 months, unexpected tier changes
    6. Dispute generation: Auto-create templated legal dispute documents with regulatory references
    7. Delivery: PDF disputes ranked by ROI; customer submits or we submit via carrier API
  
  revenue_model: |
    Performance-based commission: 15% of total agreed-upon credits recovered.
    Example: Customer with $1M annual overpayment → system recovers $900K → founder takes $135K (15%).
    Aligned incentive: founder motivated to find real errors only (disputes must be factually grounded).
  
  first_year_revenue_usd: 42000000
  first_year_users: 150
  projected_users_year_1: |
    150–200 enterprise IT leaders with $10M–$500M telecom spend.
    Customer profile: CIOs, IT directors at Fortune 2000 companies, global telecom managers.
    Viral loop: CFOs talk; when one IT team recovers $800K effortlessly, competitors take notice.
  
  roi_time_in_months: 1.5
  roi_breakdown: |
    Week 6: First 3–5 pilot customers provided bills + contracts.
    Week 8: First dispute documents generated; accuracy >90%.
    Week 10: First disputes submitted to carriers.
    Week 12: First credits issued by carriers ($150K–$500K across 3–5 customers).
    Founder commission (15%): $22.5K–$75K within 12 weeks.
    Time-to-ROI on MVP investment ($150K): ~6–8 weeks.

feasibility_score: 8.4
feasibility_justification: |
  Why it works:
  - LLM capability is mature: Claude + GPT-4 are exceptional at dense bill parsing and contract interpretation.
    Public benchmarks show >95% accuracy on financial document extraction.
  - Data readily available: Customers have bills and contracts (not proprietary or scarce).
  - Outcome measurable: Carriers issue credits in writing (verifiable, auditable).
  - MVP achievable: First 5–10 customers can be served with LLM + human review on high-value disputes.
    No complex integrations required; PDF upload is sufficient.
  - Carrier relationships: Most major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, Orange, Vodafone) have established dispute processes;
    automated submission is feasible.
  
  Blockers:
  - Carriers may contest disputes (delay customer credit by 4–8 weeks).
    Mitigation: Disputes are factually grounded (bill math + contract terms); weak carriers cave; strong ones recheck and issue credits.
  - Contract interpretation disputes (ambiguous language in 300-page SLAs).
    Mitigation: Legal review of high-value disputes ($500K+) before customer submission.

risk_analysis: |
  Technical risks:
  - LLM hallucination on extracted charges: Mitigated by multiple-pass validation, human review on >$100K disputes.
  - Incomplete contract ingestion: Mitigated by asking customers to highlight relevant sections.
  
  Market risks:
  - Carrier resistance: Some carriers aggressively dispute valid claims. Mitigated by legal memoranda; published case results.
  - Slow customer acquisition: Enterprise sales cycles are 3–6 months. Mitigated by LinkedIn outreach to IT directors, advisory partnerships.
  
  Regulatory/legal risks:
  - Incorrect dispute claims (disputing valid charges): Mitigated by legal review, conservative error flagging.
  - Telecom regulation varies by country (US, EU, Asia different rules). Mitigated by focusing initially on US, expanding after validating playbook.
  
  Fraud risk (LOW):
  - Disputes must be factually grounded (bill math is verifiable).
  - Carriers can easily audit claims; false disputes harm founder reputation + future business.
  - Mitigation: Conservative approach; only flag high-confidence errors.

legal_and_ethical:
  compliance: |
    Compliant with telecom industry regulations (FCC rules on consumer billing, state-level telecom laws).
    Disputes use contractual audit rights (customers have right to dispute); no regulatory violation.
    No unauthorized access to carrier systems (disputes submitted via official channels).
  
  ethical_position: |
    Solves real customer problem: overcharges are genuine, and customers have contractual rights to dispute.
    No manipulation or deception: disputes must be factually sound.
    Sustainable: customers remain customers as long as we recover real money.
