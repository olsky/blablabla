title: Government Procurement Intelligence & Proposal Automation
description: US government spends $600B/year on contracts. 80% goes to 30K incumbents; SMBs miss 95% of opportunities ($40–$60B/year). This AI system ingests SAM.gov + state procurement portals, matches opportunities to company capability, auto-generates compliant proposals (80% of proposal work), tracks submissions, optimizes recommendations. Result SMBs find 5–20 qualified bids/month (vs. 1–3), win rate improves 3–5x, proposals done in hours not weeks.

value_proposition: Discover government contract opportunities matching your capabilities. Auto-generate compliant proposals in minutes. Track wins/losses. Improve bid success rate 3–5x in 6 months. Eliminate hiring expensive capture managers.

target_customer: Small government contractors ($5M–$500M revenue); minority/women-owned businesses (MWBEs); veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs); manufacturers with excess capacity; services firms (IT, consulting, logistics, security).

business_case:
  problem_statement: Federal market $600B total; SMB addressable $200B–$250B; actual SMB capture $50–$60B (25% penetration). SMBs don't know about 95% of bids they could win. Manual SAM.gov search (2–4 hours/day). Capture manager spends 20–40 hours per proposal ($150K+/year salary). Multi-month sales cycles. Win rate 5–15%. Opportunity matching is data problem (100K+ bids/year; find the 5–10 YOU can win) → ML solves. Proposal generation is language problem (create compliant text fast) → LLMs excel.
  
  solution_approach: 1) Daily pulls from SAM.gov, state procurement portals, GSA schedules (all free public APIs). 2) Opportunity matching (score 1–100 for fit; keyword match, financial viability, past performance alignment). 3) Proposal automation (customer provides company summary + past performance once; auto-generate NAICS narrative, pricing, technical approach, compliance language). 4) Submission tracking (calendar alerts, outcome tracking). 5) Learning loop (after 10 submissions model learns win patterns; recommend best opportunities).
  
  target_metrics: Bid opportunity discovery 10–50 qualified/month (vs. 1–3). Proposal turnaround 2–4 hours (vs. 20–40). Win rate improvement 3–5x in 6 months. Revenue per customer $500K–$5M/year additional government.
  
  assumptions: Government customers highly motivated. SAM.gov APIs usable. Proposal templates learnable. SMBs provide past-performance examples.
  
  revenue_model: 'SaaS tiered: Tier 1 $249/mo (5 opportunities, 2 proposals) → Tier 2 $999/mo (unlimited) → Tier 3 $4,999/mo (premium coaching). OR success-based 5–10% of contract value. OR hybrid freemium + premium. Recommended Tier 1 + success-based if >$500K contract.'
  
  product_roadmap: 'Phase 1 Weeks 1–8: MVP opportunity matching (SAM API, matching algorithm, dashboard). Phase 2 Weeks 9–12: Proposal AI (template library, LLM integration). Phase 3 Months 4–6: Learning + expansion (outcome tracking, state/local procurement, past-perf analysis).'
  
  feasibility_score_narrative: SAM APIs stable. NLP/LLM for proposals proven. Matching straightforward classification. Low technical risk. COTS APIs + standard ML.
  
  deployment_model: SaaS only (minimal IT integration; easy signup).
  
  success_criteria: Customer acquisition 500–1000 SMBs Year 1. ARPU $3K–$6K. Contract win rate >20%. Retention >80%.

  user_segment_distribution: 'Small contractors ($5M–$50M) 800–1500 @ $500/year freemium + $2K premium = $2.8M–$5M. Growth-stage ($50M–$200M) 200–400 @ $5K–$10K = $1M–$4M. Enterprise gov ($200M+) 50–100 @ $20K = $1M–$2M. Conservative Year 1 800 SMBs @ $2K + 100 mid-tier @ $7K = $2.3M. Realistic 1200 @ $2.5K + 300 @ $8K = $5.4M. Optimistic 1850 @ $3K + 500 @ $8K = $9.55M.'

  dependencies: SAM.gov API access. State procurement portal APIs. LLM API access. Optional SBA partnership.

feasibility_score: 9.1

risk_analysis: 'Technical (SAM API changes/rate limits; mitigation cache daily). Business (customers need hand-holding; mitigation freemium + onboarding videos). Market (larger competitors; mitigation undercut price, focus SMB, feature speed). Government win conversion low (mitigation focus realistic bids only).'
