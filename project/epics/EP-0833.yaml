title: Autonomous Digital Estate 'Executor' Agent
description: |
  **Idea:** Probate and estate settlement takes 12-24 months and costs 5% of the estate. This AI agent is a 'Digital Executor' sitting inside an escrow. When a death certificate is verified via government API, the agent autonomously logs into the deceased's accounts, closes subscriptions, liquidates specific assets as per the will, and settles the funds to the heirs' wallets via smart contract.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns a multi-year human legal nightmare into a 24-hour algorithmic settlement. It is the first 'Immortal Lawyer' for the $68T Great Wealth Transfer.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Complex legal-compliance coding and multi-account API 'executor' access logic).
  - Cash Out: 1% final estate settlement fee (5x cheaper than a human lawyer).

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Estate Value Processed: $15,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Legal challenges from disinherited relatives suing the algorithm's interpretation of the deceased's 'intent'.
  - Medium: Gaining secure, legal 'Executor' access to sensitive accounts across multiple jurisdictions.
  - Low: Scale (The elderly hold trillions in wealth that is about to move).
