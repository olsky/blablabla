title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Future Government Subsidies
description: |
  **Idea:** Companies (Green Tech, Chips) are promised billions in 'Chips Act' or 'Green' subsidies, but they wait 3 years for the cash. This platform tokenizes the 'Future Subsidy'. The AI underwriters the 'Government Payout Risk' and buys the subsidy rights for $0.80 on the dollar, providing instant capex to the builder.

  **Why "WOW":** It treats 'Government Promises' as a high-yield institutional debt asset. It provides the capex bridge for the entire hardware revolution.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Building the 'Sovereign-Default' subsidy underwriting model and the tokenization ledger).
  - Cash Out: 3% origination fee on every subsidy tokenized.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Total Subsidy Value Tokenized: $5,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A change in government (Election) leading to the cancellation of the pre-promised subsidy programs.
  - Medium: Complex legal assignment rules for government payouts varying by country.
  - Low: Founder Demand (They need money to build the factory NOW, not in 2029).
