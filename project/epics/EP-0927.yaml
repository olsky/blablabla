title: "Database Query Cost Optimization Engine"
description: |
  Autonomous agent that analyzes SQL query logs across enterprise databases
  (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery) to identify inefficient queries,
  recommend indexes, and predict execution costs. Leverages existing database
  system catalogs, query statistics, and EXPLAIN plans via standard APIs.
  Reduces query runtime by 40-70% and database costs by $1K-$50K/month per customer.
problem_statement: |
  Fortune 500 companies waste $100B+ annually on inefficient database queries
  (10-30% of total database costs). Engineers manually debug queries; most
  optimization opportunities go unnoticed. Larger companies employ dedicated
  database teams; mid-market lacks this expertise entirely.
solution:
  approach: Query log ingestion → Parse EXPLAIN plans → ML feature extraction → 
    Index recommendation engine → Cost prediction model → Automated alerts/reports
  technical_stack:
    - Data source: PostgreSQL/MySQL query logs, CloudWatch, BigQuery audit logs
    - ML: Gradient boosting (cost prediction), rule-based recommendation engine
    - Infrastructure: Python agents + cron scheduler
  revenue_model: |
    Tiered SaaS ($1K-$10K/month) + 20% of database savings (first 12 months).
    Example: Customer saves $20K/month → pays $4K/month base + $4K success fee.
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 3200000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 140
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2285
feasibility_score: 9.1
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Weeks 1-2: API integrations; 3-4: EXPLAIN parsing + indexing logic; 5-6: ML model; 7-8: dashboard + launch)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Query log formats vary; mitigation = standardize top 80% (Postgres, MySQL).
  Business: Customer database access sensitivity; mitigation = self-hosted option.
  Market: Competing with open-source EXPLAIN tools; mitigation = agent autonomy + recommendations.
