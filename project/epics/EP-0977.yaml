title: Cloud Security Posture Management Agent
description: Autonomous cloud security agent that continuously monitors, discovers, and remediates cloud misconfigurations across AWS/GCP/Azure without human intervention.
problem_statement: Organizations lose $4.24B annually to cloud misconfigurations (exposed S3 buckets, open security groups, unencrypted databases). Manual remediation requires specialist time (60+ hours/month). Existing CSPM tools generate 10K+ false positives/month.
solution:
  approach: Agent continuously scans cloud infrastructure, correlates findings with baseline configs, auto-remediates low-risk issues (apply default tags, enable encryption), and escalates complex decisions to human approvers.
  technical_stack: AWS/GCP/Azure SDKs, Kubernetes Operators for remediation, OpenAI for decision logic, PostgreSQL for compliance tracking, Slack for notifications.
  revenue_model: "SaaS: $500-2K/month per cloud account; success-based: 5-15% of cost savings from remediation ($50K-500K annually per customer)."
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2900000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 220
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1100
feasibility_score: 8.9
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 8 weeks (AWS + GCP only). Full: 12 weeks (add Azure + Kubernetes)."
risk_analysis: "Risk: Cloud provider API limits. Mitigation: Batch scanning at off-peak hours. Risk: Remediation errors breaking production. Mitigation: Dry-run mode + human approval for first 100 changes."
