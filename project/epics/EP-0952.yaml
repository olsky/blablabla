title: "Compliance Training Effectiveness Intelligence"
description: |
  ML system that predicts which employees are at highest risk of non-compliance violations
  based on training history, assessment scores, role behavior, and demographics. Recommends
  targeted retraining and monitors compliance incidents post-training. Reduces compliance
  violations by 40-60%. HIPAA, SOX, SOC2 focused initially.
problem_statement: |
  $150B+ annual compliance violations/fines; most are preventable via better training.
  Annual compliance training is checkbox exercise; no assessment of true behavioral change.
  High-risk employees (new hires, contractors) receive uniform training (no personalization).
problem_statement: |
  Real, quantifiable risk: Each compliance violation ($10K-$10M in fines) plus reputational damage.
solution:
  approach: |
    Employee data ingest (training history, assessment scores, role, department, tenure) →
    Risk profiling (behavioral patterns, violation history) → Personalized training pathway
    recommendations → Post-training outcome tracking (incident reduction, improvement in
    assessments) → Continuous model refinement
  technical_stack:
    - Data: LMS APIs (Cornerstone, SAP SuccessFactors), incident tracking systems
    - ML: Risk prediction, causal inference for training effectiveness
    - Agents: Training recommendations, outcome monitoring
  revenue_model: "SaaS per employee ($0.50-2.00/employee/month) + outcome-based fees"
business_case:

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (LMS integration → risk modeling → training optimization → outcome tracking)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Potential discrimination if targeting by protected attributes; mitigation = bias audits.
  Adoption: L&D team skepticism; mitigation = transparent methodology + pilot evidence.
  Data: Employee privacy concerns; mitigation = aggregate reporting only.
