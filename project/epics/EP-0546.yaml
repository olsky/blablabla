title: Automated Music License Sync Clearinghouse
description: |
  **Idea:** Getting the rights to put a specific song in a YouTube video or Indie film takes months of emails to publishers. This platform aggregates all indie/mid-tier music catalogs. Video editors upload their video; the system uses Computer Vision/NLP to analyze the mood. It suggests the perfect tracks, and instantly, algorithmically generates a bespoke, legally binding Sync License based on the video's predicted reach/budget, clearing the payment instantly to the artist.

  **Why "WOW":** Brings the liquid speed of stock-photography (Getty) to complex audio sync rights.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (Building the mood-matching ML and the smart-contract dynamic licensing engine).
  - Cash Out: 20% platform fee on all cleared sync rights.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Syncs Cleared: 1,500,000\n  - Avg Ticket: $350
  - Estimated Revenue: $105,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Acquiring the initial supply catalog of high-quality music.
  - Medium: Enforcing the license if the video dramatically outperforms the paid tier.
  - Low: Creator demand (Video editors hate manual legal clearance).
