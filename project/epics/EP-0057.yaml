title: Autonomous EV Fleet Battery Warranty Claim Recovery Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Logistics fleets transitioning to EVs frequently miss battery warranty compensation because degradation events are detected too late and claim evidence is incomplete. This service ingests telematics, charging logs, BMS diagnostics, route stress factors, and OEM warranty policy feeds to autonomously identify claimable deterioration patterns.

  Agents generate OEM-compliant claim dossiers, submit through warranty portals, track outcomes, and optimize charging policy to reduce future failures.

  **Why "WOW":** Fleet operators convert technical battery data directly into recovered cash and lower TCO.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (BMS normalization, policy engine, claim automation).
  - Cash Out: per-vehicle monitoring subscription + recovery share.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Fleet Customers: 1,050
  - Vehicles Monitored: 420,000
  - Subscription Revenue: $8,400,000
  - Claim Success Share Revenue: $4,900,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $13,300,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: OEM data interoperability differences; mitigated by adapter layer and OEM-specific policy packs.
  - Medium: Dispute cycles can be long; mitigated with SLA tracking and pre-validation confidence checks.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Uses authentic telematics evidence and warranty terms; does not falsify degradation or claim history.
