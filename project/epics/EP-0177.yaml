title: "Autonomous Terminal Tariff Compliance & Under-Billing Leakage Recovery Engine"
description: |
  **Idea:** Terminal tariffs are intricate books covering stevedoring, storage, reefer care, hazardous surcharges, extra lifts, special handling, and more. Every box generates a constellation of chargeable events — but billing engines and human clerks routinely **miss or mis-rate** events. Industry insiders estimate 2–5% of potential revenue is never invoiced or is under-billed.

  This engine ingests:
  - Full terminal event stream from TOS (move events, work instructions, yard actions, special services)
  - Tariff books and customer-specific contract overrides
  - Existing invoices and credit-note history

  Agents then:
  - Reconstruct what *should* have been billed for each box and call
  - Compare against what was actually invoiced
  - Identify missed and under-billed charges with exact references to tariff clauses
  - Generate supplemental invoices and recommended contract clean-ups

  **Why "WOW":** Terminals run on thin margins and invest billions in hardware. Quietly leaking a few percent of top line to invoicing misses is insane, but common. An autonomous engine that plugs that leak is **pure found money**.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 months (event-to-tariff mapping logic, contract-override engine, billing integrations)
  - Cash Out: Recovery-share on newly detected revenue and reduction of chronic mis-billing.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Terminals Onboarded: 60
  - Aggregate Annual Revenue Under Audit: $5,400,000,000
  - Under-Billing Rate (conservative 2.5%): $135,000,000
  - Recoverable Portion in Y1 (70%): $94,500,000
  - Platform Share (40%): $37,800,000
  - Forward-Looking Leakage Prevention Fee (fixed SaaS): $80,000,000
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $117,800,000**

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.6/10 — TOS events and tariffs are structured. The challenge is careful handling of customer-specific deals — but those are contractually documented.

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Customer relationship sensitivity around back-billing; mitigated by focusing first on clearly missed standard charges and offering amnesties for historical periods
  - Low: Data rights; terminals own TOS and billing events

  **Legal & Ethical:** Ensures customers are billed per the contracts and public tariffs they agreed to. No hidden or retroactive fees beyond contractual rights.
