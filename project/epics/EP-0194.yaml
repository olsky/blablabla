title: Autonomous Semiconductor Packaging & Assembly Routing Optimizer
description: An API that connects fab output with OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) capacity globally. It automatically routes bare dies to the optimal OSAT facility based on real-time capacity, yield rates, and shipping costs.
status: Draft
priority: High
business_value:
  revenue_potential: "$150,000,000+"
  market_size: "$600 Billion (Global Semiconductor Manufacturing)"
  target_audience: Tier 1 and Tier 2 Semiconductor Fabs (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, GlobalFoundries) and OSATs (ASE, Amkor)
  value_proposition: "Automatically route bare dies to the optimal OSAT facility based on real-time capacity, yield rates, and shipping costs, maximizing throughput and minimizing costs."

  roi_calculator: "$0.01 per chip routed through the optimizer."
  first_year_projections:
    revenue: "$150,000,000"
    users: 20 Enterprise Fabs & OSATs
feasibility_score: 8.5
risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "Integrating with multiple OSAT capacity management systems and global shipping logistics can be complex and require robust error handling."
  market_risks: "Fabs may be hesitant to fully automate their packaging and assembly routing, requiring a phased rollout with human-in-the-loop oversight."
  compliance_risks: "Must adhere to international trade regulations and export controls."
legal_ethical_considerations:
  - "Ensure all automated routing decisions comply with international trade regulations and export controls."
  - "Implement robust audit logging to track all automated routing decisions."
