title: Cross-Border Arbitrage & HTS Tariff Optimizer API
description: |
  **Idea:** Global supply chains bleed billions because items are misclassified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), resulting in overpaid import taxes. This API plugs directly into Shopify, SAP, and major ERP systems. Using computer vision (to analyze product images) and LLMs (to parse manufacturing spec sheets), it instantly, autonomously maps any SKU to the absolute lowest legally permissible HTS duty code globally before a container ships. When customs queries a code, the system autonomously generates a multi-page legal justification defense packet citing historical customs rulings (WCO) and tariff precedents.

  **Why "WOW":** Traditional compliance consultants charge thousands per SKU and take weeks. This API does it in milliseconds for pennies, provably saving B2B importers millions in pure bottom-line capital instantly.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (Fine-tuning LLMs on the global database of hundreds of thousands of historical customs rulings and HTS codes, ERP API integrations).
  - Cash Out: $0.10 API call per classify or 5% of proven duty minimized.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - SKUs Classified: 1,500,000,000.
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000.

  **Feasibility Score:** 9.5/10 (LLMs are exceptionally good at navigating complex, highly constrained legal taxonomies like HTS codes; the data is all public).

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Direct API integration bottlenecks with legacy on-premise ERP systems like older SAP instances.
  - Medium: Aggressive customs audits (Mitigated by the automated legal defense generator).
  - Low: Competition (Existing solutions are mostly human-in-the-loop consultancies).
