title: "Freight Insurance Claim Prediction & Optimization"
description: |
  ML system for freight carriers and logistics that predicts shipment damage/loss risk
  based on route, cargo, carrier, weather, and historical patterns. Recommends insurance
  optimization (which shipments to insure, coverage levels). Reduces insurance costs 15-25%
  while improving claim coverage accuracy.
problem_statement: |
  $400B+ annual freight/logistics market; damage/loss claims exceed $10B (2-3% of shipment
  value). Insurance is one-size-fits-all (% of value); no risk-based pricing. Carriers
  self-insure optimally but lack data tools. Claims are reactive; no prevention strategy.
solution:
  approach: |
    Shipment data ingest (origin/destination, cargo type/value, carrier, mode, weather) →
    Damage/loss risk prediction → Insurance recommendation (coverage type, deductible,
    exclusions) → Claims analysis (validate claim legitimacy, identify root cause) →
    Prevention recommendations (improved packaging, carrier selection, route optimization)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Logistics APIs, weather data, historical claims, cargo databases
    - ML: Damage risk prediction, insurance optimization
    - Agents: Risk alerts, insurance recommendations, claim support
  revenue_model: "SaaS per carrier ($2K-10K/month) + % of insurance premium savings (5-15%)"

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Logistics API integration → damage prediction → insurance optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Carrier data integration; mitigation = work with industry platforms (Descartes, Fourkites).
  Business: Requires carrier data sharing; mitigation = aggregated/anonymized insights.
  Insurance: Insurance companies resistant to transparency; mitigation = sell to carriers not insurers.
