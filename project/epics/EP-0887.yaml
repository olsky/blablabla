title: Autonomous 'Algorithmic-Ethics' Audit-as-a-Service
description: |
  **Idea:** New EU/US laws (EU AI Act) require companies to 'Audit' their AI models for bias and ethics. This is currently a manual disaster. This AI agent acts as a 'Probe'. It autonomously 'Attacks' the company's internal AI models with 1M test-cases to find bias/hallucinations, generates the legally-perfect 'Ethics-Certification', and submits it to the regulator's API.

  **Why "WOW":** It is an 'AI auditing an AI'. It solves the single biggest legal bottleneck for the AI-industry itself through autonomous probing and certification.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the 'Ethics-Probe' LLM and the legal compliance reporting engine).
  - Cash Out: $50k per 'Ethics-Probe' and certification issued.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Enterprise AI Models Audited: 3,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The 'Ethics-Probe' missing a subtle bias, and the company still being sued even after being 'Certified' by the agent.
  - Medium: Regulators refusing to accept 'Automated Audits' and demanding a human auditor sign-off.
  - Low: Enterprise Necessity (You cannot legally deploy AI without these audits in the EU soon).
