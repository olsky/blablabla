title: Autonomous Export Control & Dual-Use Technology Guardian
description: |
  **Idea:** Tech companies face billion-dollar fines for accidentally exporting 'Dual-Use' technology (chips, lasers, software) to restricted countries. This AI agent monitors every outbound shipping manifesting ERP. It uses semantic analysis on technical specs to determine if a component falls under EAR (Export Administration Regulations). It autonomously blocks the shipment, generates the required license application, and submits it to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) API.

  **Why "WOW":** Automated, super-human insurance against the single biggest legal threat to the tech industry. It turns a nightmare of legal paperwork into a 100% autonomous guardrail.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Training the semantic legal model on EAR/ITAR regulations and integrating with enterprise SAP/Oracle ERPs).
  - Cash Out: Enterprise SaaS: $250k/year per major tech exporter.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Enterprise Clients: 600
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A 'Hallucination' in the model missing a restricted high-performance chip and triggering a DOJ investigation.
  - Medium: The complexity of mapping vague regulatory text to precise hardware engineering CAD files.
  - Low: The fear factor (Executives go to jail for export violations; they will buy this guardrail).
