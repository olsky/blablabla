title: "Processing Plant Line Speed & Yield Optimizer"
description: |
  Autonomous system monitoring processing line sensors, hang times, temperature
  profiles, and QA rejection data to optimize line speed and product mix in real-time.
  Agents predict quality failures, recommend product transitions, and maximize
  throughput while minimizing waste.
problem_statement: |
  Processing accounts for 15-25% of poultry margins. A 5% improvement in line
  efficiency or yield = $200M+ industry value. Current optimization is manual
  (scheduling, speed adjustments) and reactive. Modern plants have rich sensor data
  (scalping, bleeding, chilling, packaging) but no intelligence layer exploiting it.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest processing line sensors (hang patterns, evisceration reject rates,
    chilling times, product dimension/weight data). Build predictive models of
    quality failures by product type and line speed. Agents recommend speed
    adjustments, product mix changes, and maintenance windows. Continuously learn
    from QA outcomes and optimize throughput.
  technical_stack: |
    Processing plant PLC APIs, weight/dimension sensors, temperature monitoring,
    QA/rejection logging systems, real-time optimization (reinforcement learning or
    constraint solvers), automated alerts.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per plant ($5K-20K/month) + performance share (2-4% of yield/efficiency gains).

risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Plant PLC integration complex; mitigation: partner with automation
  vendors (Marel, Meyn) for API access. Business: Food safety concerns; mitigation:
  all changes logged and reversible; third-party QA audit trails maintained.
