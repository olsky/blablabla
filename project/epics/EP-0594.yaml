title: Automated Commercial Mortgage Backed Security (CMBS) Restructuring Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** The commercial real estate market is crashing, and trillions in skyscraper loans need to be renegotiated. Human lawyers take months. This system ingests the complex, 500-page CMBS trust documents. It uses LLMs to mathematically model the 'waterfall' payouts to different bondholders. It autonomously generates proposed restructuring term sheets (e.g., extending the loan 2 years at a higher rate) that legally maximize value for the highest-tier bondholders, bypassing investment bankers entirely.

  **Why "WOW":** Algorithmically unwinds the most complex, toxic debt structures in the global economy.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Training LLMs on dense real estate finance law and complex bond waterfall mathematics).
  - Cash Out: A $1M fixed fee per major skyscraper restructuring.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Major Restructurings Executed: 150
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Hedge funds (subordinate bondholders) suing the algorithm's interpretation of the restructuring waterfall.
  - Medium: Parsing incredibly poorly scanned PDF legacy mortgage documents.
  - Low: Need (Trillions in CRE debt is maturing; there aren't enough humans to process the crash).
