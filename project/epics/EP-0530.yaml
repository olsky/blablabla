title: Autonomous Corporate Fraud & Embezzlement Detective
description: |
  **Idea:** Mid-market companies bleed 5% of revenue to internal fraud. Traditional audits only check 1% of transactions randomly. This agent connects to the corporate ERP, bank feeds, and Slack/Email NLP. It autonomously reconciles 100% of physical receipts against geolocation data, flags suspicious vendor invoice patterns (shell companies), and mathematically isolates embezzlers in real-time without human auditors.

  **Why "WOW":** Infinite perfectly vigilant auditors working 24/7. Catches fraud the millisecond it’s entered into the ledger.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (ERP integrations, NLP anomaly detection).
  - Cash Out: $5k/month SaaS per enterprise.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Enrolled Enterprises: 3,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $180,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: False positives disrupting legitimate corporate spending.
  - Medium: Data privacy hurdles for ingesting employee comms.
  - Low: Sales motion (CFOs will mandate this).
