title: "Dynamic E-Commerce Pricing Optimizer"
description: |
  Real-time pricing engine for e-commerce that monitors competitor prices,
  inventory levels, demand signals, and customer segments to autonomously
  recommend or apply price adjustments. Integrates with Shopify, WooCommerce,
  Magento via webhooks. Increases COGS-adjusted margin by 5-15%.
problem_statement: |
  E-commerce leaves $50B+ annually on the table due to static pricing.
  Competitors use dynamic pricing (Uber, Airbnb, Amazon); most SME retailers
  manually adjust prices weekly/monthly. Inventory risk (deadstock) costs
  retailers 5-10% of COGS annually.
solution:
  approach: |
    Real-time price monitoring (competitor APIs) → Inventory tracking → Demand
    forecast → Elasticity estimation → Price recommendation engine → Webhook
    updates to storefronts
  technical_stack:
    - Data sources: Shopify API, Magento, WooCommerce, competitor price feeds
    - ML: Elasticity estimation, demand forecasting, optimization algorithms
    - Orchestration: Web hooks, real-time agents
  revenue_model: "SaaS tiered ($500-5K/month based on GMV) + revenue share (1-2% of margin uplift)"

risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Competitor price feed reliability; mitigation = multiple sources.
  Business: Price wars with competitors; mitigation = margin floor enforcement.
  Legal: Pricing discrimination concerns; mitigation = transparent algorithms.
