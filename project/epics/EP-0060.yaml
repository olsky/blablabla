title: Autonomous Construction Change-Order Recovery Intelligence Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** General contractors and specialty subcontractors lose margin when valid change orders are delayed, underpriced, or never recovered. This engine ingests BIM revisions, site logs, RFI streams, schedule deltas, labor/material cost curves, and contract clauses to autonomously detect billable scope drift.

  Agents generate quantified change-order packages, simulate entitlement strength, route submissions, and monitor approval/collection cycles.

  **Why "WOW":** Hidden margin is surfaced from project execution exhaust data without manual forensic review.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (BIM and PM-system integrations, entitlement model, package generator).
  - Cash Out: percentage of approved recovery + project SaaS.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Contractor Organizations: 1,150
  - Average Annual Approved Recovery per Customer: $310,000
  - Performance Revenue (10%): $35,650,000
  - SaaS Revenue: $3,220,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $38,870,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.0/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Contract language variability; mitigated by clause libraries and jurisdiction-aware templates.
  - Medium: Source log completeness; mitigated by evidentiary confidence scores and ingestion quality diagnostics.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Supports contractual entitlement workflows only, with transparent evidence provenance and no adversarial fabrication.
