title: Autonomous Rural Broadband Grant Capture & Compliance Copilot
description: |
  **Idea:** Regional ISPs and municipalities miss public broadband grants due to complex applications and reporting. This copilot ingests coverage maps, fiber plant data, census demographics, speed-test telemetry, and grant program rules (EU, national, regional). Agents auto-generate eligibility models, draft applications with budget/engineering plans, and manage post-award compliance reporting with evidence packs.

  **Why "WOW":** Converts grant complexity into predictable cash inflow and accelerates rural coverage buildouts with minimal sales/BD overhead.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (rule ingestion, plan generator, reporting automation, GIS).
  - Cash Out: success fee on awarded grants + annual compliance SaaS.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - ISP/Muni Customers: 450
  - Average Grants Captured per Customer: $900,000
  - Success-Fee Revenue (4%): $16,200,000
  - SaaS Revenue: $3,150,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $19,350,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.3/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Program rule changes; mitigated via continuous rulepack updates and versioned applications.
  - Medium: Evidence collection gaps; mitigated with automated field data pulls (speed tests, GIS photos) and validation gates.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Compliant with grant rules; no misrepresentation of coverage; transparent evidence.
