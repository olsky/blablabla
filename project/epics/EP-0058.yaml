title: Autonomous Trade Promotion Deduction Recovery Oracle for CPG Brands
description: |
  **Idea:** CPG brands in Europe lose substantial revenue to invalid retailer trade deductions and promotion mis-settlements. This oracle ingests POS sell-through data, trade promotion calendars, ERP invoices, deduction codes, and contract terms to autonomously validate deduction legitimacy.

  Agents reconcile expected vs. actual settlement, trigger dispute workflows, bundle evidentiary timelines, and predict retailer-specific leakage patterns before campaign launch.

  **Why "WOW":** Revenue previously written off as "commercial noise" becomes systematically recoverable.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (retailer feed connectors, deduction rules graph, claim automation).
  - Cash Out: recovery performance fee + annual platform license.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - CPG Brands Onboarded: 1,700
  - Average Gross Recovery per Brand: $120,000
  - Recovery Revenue (15% share): $30,600,000
  - Platform Revenue: $6,800,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $37,400,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.7/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Retailer data heterogeneity; mitigated by normalized deduction ontology and quality gates.
  - Medium: Contract clause ambiguity; mitigated with clause parser confidence thresholds and legal-safe escalation flags.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Executes only evidence-backed contractual recovery and preserves transparent retailer-brand audit trails.
