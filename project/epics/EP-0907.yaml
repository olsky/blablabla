title: Autonomous Published Research Data Monetization Platform
description: |
  Autonomously identifies valuable academic datasets from published papers and brokers licensing to pharmaceutical companies. The system scrapes arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv for papers; extracts dataset metadata and supplementary files; classifies by commercial value (pharma interest, meta-analysis utility, new indication potential); and generates licensing offers to researchers and pharma buyers. Platform hosts normalized datasets on secure portals and tracks usage analytics.

  **Why "WOW":** Addresses $12B academic data monetization gap. FDA 21st Cures Act mandates data accessibility. Pharma desperate for diversified data sources post-COVID. 80% of datasets are lost or trapped in supplements.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Dataset discovery, de-identification, researcher + pharma outreach)
  - Cash Out: 30% of licensing fees (70% to researchers)

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Datasets onboarded: 20-50 (Tier 1 open-source, ready for licensing)
  - Pharma licenses: 2-5 agreements @ $25k-100k per dataset per year
  - Total revenue: $50-80M (by scaling to 500 datasets + 50 pharma customers Year 3)

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Researcher engagement friction; academics slow to respond and commercialize data
  - Medium: HIPAA concerns on clinical datasets; requires strict de-identification validation
  - Low: Pharma demand (consistent; therapy areas rotate but need is constant)
