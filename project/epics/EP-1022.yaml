title: "Layer House Lighting Optimization & Day-Length Agent"
description: |
  Autonomous agent managing artificial lighting schedules in layer houses to
  optimize egg production, shell quality, and bird welfare. Predicts optimal light
  duration, intensity, and timing based on flock age and production targets.
problem_statement: |
  Day length and light intensity directly control layer reproductive cycles, health,
  and production. Suboptimal lighting costs layer producers $100-300 per 1000 birds
  annually. Current systems use fixed schedules; no agent optimizes for individual
  flock genetics, age, or production phase. A 2-5% production gain = $200K+ value
  for large complexes.
solution:
  approach: |
    Build response models linking light schedules (hours per day, intensity, color
    spectrum) to flock production, egg quality, and bird behavior. Ingest flock age,
    genetics, current production curves, and market price signals. Agents recommend
    daily light adjustments to maximize revenue while maintaining animal welfare.
  technical_stack: |
    LED controller APIs, flock management MIS, light sensor feedback, production
    recording systems, forecasting models for production response.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per barn ($1.5K-4K/month) + performance share (5-8% of production gains).

risk_analysis: |
  Technical: LED controller integration; mitigation: work with major suppliers
  (Codling, Osram, Signify) for API access. Business: Welfare audits may challenge
  changes; mitigation: ensure compliance with audit standards (RSPCA, Beter Leven).
