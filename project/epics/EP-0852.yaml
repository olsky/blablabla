title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Life Insurance Settlement
description: |
  **Idea:** Policyholders often surrender life insurance for 5% cash value. This AI agent monitors public policy-lapse data. It algorithmically underwriters the user's life expectancy via anonymized health-meta-data and social-graph health markers. It buys the policy from the user at a 20% premium (compared to surrender value) and holds it as a high-yield 'Death-Bond' asset.

  **Why "WOW":** It builds a billion-dollar asset portfolio out of 'Lapsed Life' policies. It provides 4x more cash to the elderly while capturing massive institutional yield.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the life-expectancy predictive models and the policy-transfer legal logic).
  - Cash Out: Capturing the final policy payout minus the purchase cost.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Policies Underwritten/Purchased: $500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Anti-fraud legislation (STOLI laws) restricting the secondary purchase of insurance policies.
  - Medium: The AI underestimating life expectancy, leading to 'holding costs' that exceed the final payout.
  - Low: Supply (Thousands of policies lapse every day; people want cash).
