title: Autonomous Semiconductor Fab Yield Excursion Detection & Root-Cause Mesh
description: An autonomous engine that ingests SECS/GEM telemetry from hundreds of fab tools to instantly detect yield drops and automatically isolate the exact machine, chamber, or recipe step causing the excursion, saving millions in scrapped wafers.
status: Draft
priority: High
business_value:
  revenue_potential: "$150,000,000+"
  market_size: "$600 Billion (Global Semiconductor Manufacturing)"
  target_audience: Tier 1 and Tier 2 Semiconductor Fabs (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, GlobalFoundries)
  value_proposition: "Instantly detect and isolate yield excursions, saving millions of dollars in scrapped wafers per incident without human intervention."
technical_complexity:
  estimated_effort: High
  key_technologies:
    - SECS/GEM Protocol Parsers
    - Apache Flink (Real-time Stream Processing)
    - PyTorch (Anomaly Detection & Root-Cause Analysis)
    - Kafka/Redpanda (High-throughput Telemetry Ingestion)
  integration_points:
    - Fab Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)
    - Equipment Engineering Systems (EES)
    - Yield Management Systems (YMS)
metrics:
  kpis:
    - Time-to-Detect (TTD) Yield Excursion
    - Time-to-Isolate (TTI) Root Cause
    - Value of Wafers Saved from Scrap
  roi_calculator: "10% contingency fee on the value of wafers saved from scrap."
  first_year_projections:
    revenue: "$120,000,000"
    users: 15 Enterprise Fabs
feasibility_score: 8.5
risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "High-frequency telemetry ingestion from legacy fab equipment can be complex and require custom adapters."
  market_risks: "Fabs are highly protective of their yield data and may resist cloud-based solutions, requiring on-premise deployments."
  compliance_risks: "Must adhere to strict data security and IP protection standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2)."
legal_ethical_considerations:
  - "Ensure all data processing complies with fab IP protection agreements."
  - "Implement robust access controls and audit logging to prevent unauthorized access to yield data."
