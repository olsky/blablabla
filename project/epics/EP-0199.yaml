risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "Accurately forecasting real-time global demand and its impact on wafer pricing can be challenging and require sophisticated modeling."
  market_risks: "Foundries may be hesitant to fully automate their wafer pricing and allocation, requiring a phased rollout with human-in-the-loop oversight."
  compliance_risks: "Must adhere to antitrust regulations and fair pricing practices."
legal_ethical_considerations:
  - "Ensure all automated pricing decisions comply with antitrust regulations and fair pricing practices."
  - "Implement robust audit logging to track all automated pricing decisions."
