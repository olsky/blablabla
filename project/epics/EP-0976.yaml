title: "Customer Lifetime Value Prediction & Optimization"
description: |
  ML system that predicts customer lifetime value (CLV) at acquisition/signup, enables
  personalized business logic (pricing, features, support tier) based on CLV. Increases
  blended margin by 15-25%.
problem_statement: |
  Most companies treat all customers equally (same pricing, features, support). High-CLV
  customers subsidize low-CLV customers. No ML-based CLV prediction at acquisition time.
  Customer success teams lack forward-looking CLV visibility.
solution:
  approach: |
    Acquisition data + historical CLV → CLV prediction model → Customer segmentation →
    Pricing/feature/support personalization → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: CRM, billing, CAC data
    - ML: CLV prediction (gradient boosting)
    - Integration: Billing systems, customer success tools
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($3K-10K/month per company) + revenue share"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1700000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.3
  target_users_estimate: 55
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2576
feasibility_score: 8.8
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (CLV model → segmentation → integration with billing/CS tools)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Pricing discrimination concerns; mitigation = transparent algorithm + fairness audit.
  Business: Customer perception risk if too overt; mitigation = transparent CLV-based tiers.
  Adoption: Requires sales/CS cultural shift; mitigation = executive sponsorship.
