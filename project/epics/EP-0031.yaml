title: Autonomous Precision-Bio "Enzyme Discovery" Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** A sophisticated computational biology engine that autonomously identifies and optimizes novel enzymes for industrial use-cases (e.g., plastic degradation, carbon capture, or bioremediation). The system continuously pulls genomic data from public repositories and runs high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations via folding-agent sub-processes. It identifies high-probability "hits" and offers them as licensed IP to chemical and energy conglomerates.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 months of intensive agentic R&D (simulation tuning, bio-data indexing).
  - Cash Out: Single license fee per enzyme family ($200k - $5M) plus performance royalties.
  
  **Projections:**
  - First-Year Earnings: $650,000 (Initial proof-of-concept licenses).
  - First-Year Users: 5-10 Enterprise R&D partners.
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10 (High compute requirements, but biologically principled).
  
  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Laboratory validation of "hits" required by partners (outside our software scope).
  - Medium: Computational errors in folding predictions.
