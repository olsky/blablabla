title: "Layer House Egg Production & Nest Box Optimization"
description: |
  Autonomous system monitoring nest box utilization, egg collection timing, and
  floor-egg rates via computer vision and IoT. Agents predict optimal collection
  schedules, detect nest box failures, and identify high-loss production zones
  in real-time, reducing breakage and floor eggs by 5-12%.
problem_statement: |
  Layer producers lose 3-8% of egg revenue to floor eggs, breakage, and collection
  inefficiency. Current nest box optimization is manual and reactive. A 5% reduction
  in floor eggs = $500K+ annual value for a 100K-bird complex. Modern barns have
  data (egg counters, sensors) but no intelligence layer to exploit it.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest nest box sensors (egg counter signals), climate sensors, and video feeds
    from key zones. Agents detect floor egg zones and predict optimal collection
    windows based on bird behavior, feed intake, and light cycles. Recommend nest
    box adjustments or additional cleaning cycles. Flag broken equipment in real-time.
  technical_stack: |
    Existing egg counter APIs, climate control systems, low-cost IP cameras,
    computer vision for zone analysis, time-series forecasting of egg production,
    automated alert routing.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per barn ($2K-4K/month) + performance share (4-6% of floor-egg reduction value).
business_case:

feasibility_score: 8.7
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 8 weeks. Full: 11 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Sensor integration with older barns; mitigation: modular adapters for
  legacy systems. Business: Labor resistance (workers see system as monitoring);
  mitigation: frame as productivity aid, show payroll savings opportunities.
