title: "Talent Acquisition Pre-Screening & Resume Intelligence Engine"
description: |
  ML system for recruiters and HR that auto-screens resumes against job requirements,
  predicts candidate quality/fit, and identifies hidden talent (resume gappers, career changers).
  Integrates with ATS systems (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever) via APIs. Reduces time-to-hire by 40-60%.
problem_statement: |
  Recruiting costs $5K-30K per hire; hiring cycle averages 40+ days. Recruiters screen
  100+ resumes per position; 80% are rejected within 10 seconds. Best candidates often
  have non-traditional backgrounds; 20-30% are screened out prematurely. Unconscious bias
  in manual screening costs companies $50B+ annually in missed talent.
solution:
  approach: |
    Resume ingest (PDF parsing, text extraction) → Skill extraction (job titles, technologies,
    education) → Job requirements matching (NLP) → Candidate quality scoring → Culture
    fit prediction → Hidden talent flags (career returners, adjacent skills) → Ranking
    and recommendations
  technical_stack:
    - Data: ATS APIs, resume parsing, job description extraction
    - ML: NLP for skill matching, candidate quality scoring, bias detection
    - Agents: Resume processing, candidate ranking, hidden talent identification
  revenue_model: "SaaS per recruiting team ($1K-5K/month) + per-hire fees ($100-500)"

implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (ATS integration → resume parsing → skill extraction → matching model)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Fair Hiring Act compliance (no discrimination); mitigation = bias audits + transparency.
  Adoption: Recruiter skepticism of automation; mitigation = augment (not replace) human judgment.
  Data: Resume parsing accuracy varies; mitigation = human review for close calls.
