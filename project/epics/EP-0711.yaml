title: Generative Smart Contract Automated Bug-Bounty Claimer
description: |
  **Idea:** Web3 protocols post massive bounties ($1M+) on platforms like Immunefi for anyone who can find critical bugs in their code. Exploiting them maliciously is illegal; finding them ethically is immensely profitable. This system utilizes a swarm of fine-tuned large language models and symbolic execution engines to autonomously read every line of Solidity/Rust code deployed on mainnet. When it mathematically proves a vulnerability (e.g., a reentrancy attack), it automatically generates the proof-of-concept code and submits a private, encrypted claim to the protocol's developer team.

  **Why "WOW":** Turns an army of AI models into the most lucrative, legal white-hat hacking collective on earth, running 24/7.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Training the specialized LLM payload on Solidity exploits and building automated fuzzing environments).
  - Cash Out: Massive, infrequent payout spikes. (Finding 50 critical $2M bugs per year).

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Critical Bugs Identified & Vetted: 100\n  - Average Payout: $1.2M
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Protocols refusing to pay the bounty, claiming the code was 'experimental' or they 'already knew about it' (Standard Bug Bounty friction).
  - Medium: The AI hallucinating exploits that don't actually exist, wasting developer time and leading to a platform ban.
  - Low: Scale (Deploying more compute directly equals reading more code).
