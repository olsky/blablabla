title: Autonomous OTA Commission Reconciliation & Recovery Engine for Hotels
description: |
  **Idea:** Hotels and hospitality groups often lose margin to OTA commission mischarges, parity-violation penalties, and incorrect cancellation-fee deductions hidden across thousands of bookings. This engine ingests PMS records, channel-manager logs, OTA invoices, cancellation windows, and rate-plan contracts to autonomously reconcile expected vs. charged commissions.

  Agents generate dispute packets, submit recovery claims through OTA partner workflows, monitor resolution SLA, and optimize future rate-plan structures to reduce recurring leakage.

  **Why "WOW":** Revenue managers recover hidden profit without adding reconciliation staff, turning opaque OTA billing into a transparent cashflow lever.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (PMS/channel connectors, commission-rules graph, claim automation).
  - Cash Out: recovery success fee + property subscription.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Hotel/Group Customers: 2,800
  - Average Recoverable OTA Leakage per Customer: $55,000
  - Gross Recoveries: $154,000,000
  - Success-Fee Revenue (14%): $21,560,000
  - Subscription Revenue: $4,760,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $26,320,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: OTA policy changes; mitigated with continuously updated policy adapters and versioned reconciliation rules.
  - Medium: Data latency from channel managers; mitigated through delayed-close reconciliation windows.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Enforces contract-aligned billing recovery only, with evidence-backed claims and transparent audit trails.
