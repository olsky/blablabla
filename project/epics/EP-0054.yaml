title: Autonomous Refund Abuse Suppression & Recovery Fabric
description: |
  **Idea:** E-commerce platforms and marketplaces lose large margins to coordinated refund abuse (wardrobing, empty-box returns, serial refunders, policy gaming). This service ingests return center scans, parcel weight anomalies, device/account graphs, payment telemetry, support transcripts, and product risk signals to autonomously score refund legitimacy before payout.

  Agents route low-risk refunds instantly (customer experience preserved), hold suspicious cases, trigger evidence requests, and auto-generate merchant-safe denial or partial-compensation outcomes. For approved abuse cases, agents recover value via inventory relisting, account-level controls, and policy tuning loops.

  **Why "WOW":** Merchants reduce refund leakage without hurting honest customers — profit recovery and customer trust improve simultaneously.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (returns-intel graph, logistics evidence connectors, policy decision engine).
  - Cash Out: per-order risk API + performance fee on prevented abuse.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Merchants Onboarded: 6,500
  - Orders Assessed: 2,100,000,000
  - API Revenue: $9,450,000
  - Prevented-Abuse Share Revenue: $11,300,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $20,750,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.4/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: False-positive denial risk; mitigated with conservative thresholds and customer-friendly fallback policies.
  - Medium: Cross-border return-policy variation; mitigated with merchant-specific policy engines and jurisdiction profiles.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Uses transparent, explainable risk controls and avoids discriminatory attributes; all decisions are auditable and appealable.
