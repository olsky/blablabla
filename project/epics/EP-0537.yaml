title: Proprietary Trading Engine for Wholesale Electricity Grids
description: |
  **Idea:** Electricity grids (PJM, CAISO) clear prices every 5 minutes based on chaotic supply/demand (Wind dropping, AC spiking). This quantitative hedge fund ingests real-time hyper-local weather, natural gas pipeline pressures, and factory shift-changes. It runs deep reinforcement learning to statistically predict the 5-minute node price, autonomously executing massive virtual power trades on the grid, providing vital algorithmic liquidity and capturing the spread.

  **Why "WOW":** Trading the most volatile commodity on earth (electricity) with absolute algorithmic precision. Energy quant finance.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building extreme low-latency grid API connections and robust predictive weather/load models).
  - Cash Out: Pure trading profits.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Capital Deployed: $200,000,000\n  - Estimated ROI: 60%
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Extreme weather tail-events (Texas freeze) destroying model parameters.
  - Medium: Regulatory changes to virtual bidding markets.
  - Low: Data access (ISO grid data is public).
