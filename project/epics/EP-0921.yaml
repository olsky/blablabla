title: Enterprise Contract Renewal Intelligence & Auto-Execution Engine
description: 'Large enterprises have 500–50,000 active contracts. Renewals expire continuously; missing renewal = sudden service loss. Current process manual tracking of 500+ expirations, owners do not know until failure, renewals late/missed, renegotiations in crisis mode. Result suboptimal terms, missed discounts, service disruption. This AI system ingests all contracts (email, CRM, management systems), extracts renewal dates via OCR+NLP, tracks countdown (alerts 90/30/7 days), auto-generates renewal documents (pulls prior terms + market comparables, suggests updated terms), handles negotiations (AI drafts counter-offer, tracks responses), executes renewal (e-signature, updates system, notifies stakeholders). Result 90% contracts renew on-time with negotiated terms; company saves 5–15% on renewal costs; zero disruptions.'

value_proposition: Centralized contract tracking across all silos. Automated reminders. Auto-generate renewal documents. Negotiate renewal terms. Execute renewals without manual work. Maintain optimal terms; reduce renewal costs 5–15%.

target_customer: Large enterprises (SaaS, tech, healthcare, financial) with 500+ active contracts; procurement teams at F500 companies; professional services (law, consulting) managing client contracts; healthcare networks (hospital agreements, supplier contracts, staff leases).

business_case:
  problem_statement: 'Enterprise contract chaos: Scale 500–50,000+ contracts per company. Visibility 60% in email/drives/memory (no central registry). Renewal blindness miss 5–15% of dates suddenly lose SaaS license/software/lease. Late renegotiation forced accept vendor terms or lose service. Cost bleed late renewals at worse terms (no time to shop), overpay 5–15%. Operational chaos service interruptions (licenses lapse, credits expire, leases default). Manual doesn't work 100+ contracts per procurement team; tracking 5K+ dates impossible. Contracts stored email, Salesforce, Oracle, SharePoint, drives—no standardization.'
  
  solution_approach: '1) Data ingest (email, Salesforce, contract management platforms, cloud storage). 2) Contract extraction (OCR + NLP find renewal clauses "renews unless cancelled 30 days prior"). 3) Date extraction (parse expiration, renewal notice window, auto-renewal terms). 4) Tracking (registry what we have, owner, expiration). 5) Alerting (90/30/7 day reminders). 6) Renewal document generation (pull prior terms + market comparables, draft renewal, flag differences). 7) Negotiation automation (auto-generate counter-offers, track vendor responses, suggest counter-counter-offers). 8) Execution (send renewal with e-signature, track signature, update system, alert stakeholders).'
  
  target_metrics: 'Contract renewal rate >99% (vs. 85–90%). Contract visibility 100% (vs. 40–60%). Renewal processing time <5 hours per contract (vs. 20–40). Cost savings 5–15% reduction renewal terms annually.'
  
  assumptions: Contracts have structured renewal clauses. Company consolidates contract data. Renewal automation acceptable to procurement. Market pricing data available.
  
  revenue_model: 'SaaS tiered by contract volume: Tier 1 (500–2K contracts) $3K/mo ($36K/yr); Tier 2 (2K–10K) $10K/mo ($120K/yr); Tier 3 (10K+) $25K–$50K/mo ($300K–$600K/yr). OR success-based % cost savings (5%). OR hybrid base + success bonus. Recommended Tier 1 + optional Tier 2 success.'
  
  product_roadmap: 'Phase 1 Weeks 1–8: MVP registry + alerting (data pipeline weeks 1–2, extraction NLP weeks 3–4, dashboard+alerts weeks 5–6, pilot testing weeks 7–8). Phase 2 Weeks 9–12: Renewal automation (document generation weeks 9–10, e-signature weeks 11–12). Phase 3 Months 4–6: Negotiation intelligence (market comps, auto-counter-offers, competitor analysis).'
  
  feasibility_score_narrative: 'High technical: Contract extraction standard NLP. Renewal workflow well-defined. Integrations straightforward. No novel ML. Business medium risk (enterprise sales 3–6 months; procurement adoption slow). Data large volume (5K–50K contracts per customer).'
  
  deployment_model: 'SaaS (web platform, minimal IT integration).'
  
  success_criteria: 'Contract visibility 90%+ in 90 days. Renewal rate >99%. Cost savings 5–10%. NPS >70. Retention >85%.'

  dependencies: Contract data access (email, CRM, cloud APIs). NLP model for extraction. Contract management platform integrations (optional).

feasibility_score: 8.5

risk_analysis: 'Technical (contract format varies wildly; mitigation conservative thresholds, template-based NLP). Business (Icertis/exari/Apptio already have systems; mitigation integrate not replace, focus renewal automation). Market (procurement slow adoption; mitigation start with visibility, automation optional). Legal (unfavorable terms proposed; mitigation conservative defaults, human review).'
