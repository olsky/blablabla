title: Autonomous Automotive Supplier "Force Majeure" & Disruption Insurance
description: A parametric insurance product for OEMs. The system monitors real-time news, weather, and shipping data. If a critical supplier's factory is hit by a flood or a key shipping lane is blocked (like the Suez Canal), the policy automatically pays out to the OEM to cover disruption costs.
status: Draft
priority: High

    - Geospatial analysis (for mapping supplier locations and weather events)
    - Satellite imagery APIs (for event verification)
    - Smart Contracts (for automated payouts)
  integration_points:
    - Global news APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters)
    - Weather data APIs (e.g., NOAA)

  kpis:
    - Policy volume
    - Premium income
    - Payout speed and accuracy
  roi_calculator: "10% premium margin."
  first_year_projections:
    revenue: "$120,000,000"
    users: 20 major OEMs and suppliers
feasibility_score: 8.5
risk_analysis:
  technical_risks: "High potential for basis risk, where the parametric trigger does not perfectly correlate with the actual financial loss. Requires sophisticated event detection and verification models."
  market_risks: "OEMs may prefer traditional, indemnity-based insurance. Requires educating the market on the benefits of parametric coverage."
  compliance_risks: "Must partner with a licensed insurance carrier to legally sell policies."
legal_ethical_considerations:
  - "Policy terms must be extremely clear about what constitutes a trigger event to avoid disputes."
  - "The system must have a robust, auditable process for verifying trigger events to prevent fraud."
