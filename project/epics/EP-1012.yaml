title: "Broiler Shed Feed Waste & Spillage Reduction Agent"
description: |
  Autonomous agent that monitors feeder line video feeds and weight sensors to
  detect spillage patterns, stuck gates, and segregated feeding inefficiencies in
  real-time. Predicts optimal feeder settings per growth stage and triggers
  automatic gate repairs or feed adjustment recommendations.
problem_statement: |
  Feed represents 55-65% of poultry production costs. Spilled or wasted feed costs
  integrators and growers $500M+ annually in North America alone. Current detection
  relies on manual shed checks every 12-24 hours; by then, significant waste has
  occurred. No system currently optimizes feeder configuration or predicts failures.
solution:
  approach: |
    Deploy lightweight computer vision agents on existing shed cameras or low-cost
    IP cameras. Detect spillage zones and feeder anomalies. Cross-reference with
    weight sensors and consumption logs to identify waste patterns. Agent predicts
    optimal feeder adjustments per growth phase and recommends corrective actions
    (gate adjustment, feed type change, maintenance).
  technical_stack: |
    Existing shed cameras or low-cost IP cams, edge ML (YOLO/TensorFlow Lite),
    time-series analysis of feeder weights, integrator ERP APIs, alert routing.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per shed ($500-1.5K/month) + performance share (3-5% of feed waste reduction).
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2100000
  roi_time_in_months: 0.9
  target_users_estimate: 120
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1460
feasibility_score: 8.9
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 7 weeks. Full: 10 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Image quality varies by shed lighting; mitigation: IR camera support
  and adaptive thresholds. Business: Grower adoption of camera install; mitigation:
  offer temporary, portable hardware kits.
