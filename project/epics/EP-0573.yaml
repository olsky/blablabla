title: Algorithmic Corporate Treasury Cash-Sweeping Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Multi-national corporations leave billions in low-yield operational checking accounts globally. This system connects securely to the corporate Treasury APIs. Every night at 11:59PM, it algorithmically aggregates the global cash position, mathematically calculates the localized liquidity needed for the next day, and autonomously sweeps the remaining billions into the absolute highest-yielding global overnight repo-markets or short-term sovereign debt, returning the cash before 8:00AM.

  **Why "WOW":** High-frequency macro-yield optimization for stagnant corporate cash. It prints money for CFOs while they sleep.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building flawless, secure API pathways to global Tier-1 banking systems and the logic to manage FX risk).
  - Cash Out: 10% of the newly generated algorithmic interest yield.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Corporate Cash Under Management: $50,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A systemic banking freeze (e.g., 2008) locking up the swept corporate cash in overnight markets.
  - Medium: Extreme InfoSec requirements to gain writing-access to Fortune 500 treasury APIs.
  - Low: CFO Adoption (It's free yield on dead assets).
