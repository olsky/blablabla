title: AI-Driven Parametric Flight-Delay Payout Bot
description: |
  **Idea:** Millons of travelers are eligible for compensation (EU261, etc.) but 90% never claim it. This AI agent monitors global flight-tracking APIs and the user's calendar. When a delay of >3 hours occurs, the AI autonomously generates the legal claim and submits it to the airline's settlement API, releasing the cash to the user's wallet instantly.

  **Why "WOW":** It is 'Automatic Justice' for travelers. It turns airlines' 'Unclaimed Compensation' liabilities into a massive, passive cashflow engine.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (Pipelining flight-radar APIs and building the automated legal-claim bots for 500+ airlines).
  - Cash Out: 30% contingency fee on the successfully recovered cash.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Eligible Claims Identified/Recovered: $500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Airlines lobbying to restrict API access or using 'anti-bot' laws to stop the autonomous claims.
  - Medium: Inaccurate flight-data (e.g. a flight being marked as 'On Time' when it actually diverted).
  - Low: Passenger Demand (Every traveler hates airlines and wants their $250-600 back).
