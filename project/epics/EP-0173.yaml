title: "Autonomous Demurrage, Storage & Free-Time Optimization Network (Imports)"
description: |
  **Idea:** Importers and forwarders lose hundreds of millions annually to **avoidably high demurrage and storage charges** at container terminals. Free-time rules vary by carrier, route, and contract. Terminals and lines publish tariffs, but importers manage risk with spreadsheets and emails. No one is continuously optimizing container pickup/delivery decisions against demurrage/storage exposure.

  This network ingests:
  - Container event data (availability, gate moves, yard location, last free day) from TOS and carrier APIs
  - Contractual free-time rules per carrier and trade lane
  - Demurrage and storage tariffs (including tiered and weekend/holiday rules)
  - Trucker and depot capacity, appointment slots, and transit times

  Agents then:
  - Compute real-time **demurrage/storage exposure** per container and portfolio
  - Recommend and (via API) trigger optimal truck scheduling, depot moves, or carrier negotiations to minimize cost
  - Autonomously validate demurrage/storage invoices vs. contracts and events, disputing errors

  **Why "WOW":** Every importer hates demurrage bills but treats them as inevitable. An engine that monitors every box, predicts cost exposure, and orchestrates actions to reduce it is a killer app for BCOs and 3PLs.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~9 months (TOS/carrier integrations, contract-rule engine, optimization layer)
  - Cash Out: Savings-share on reduced demurrage/storage plus SaaS fees.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Importers/3PLs Onboarded: 260
  - Annual Import Volume Managed: 5,200,000 TEU
  - Baseline Demurrage/Storage Spend: $520,000,000 (avg $100/TEU)
  - Achievable Savings (25%): $130,000,000
  - Savings-Share (25%): $32,500,000
  - SaaS Subscription: $60,000,000
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $92,500,000**

  With mid-year scale to 8M+ TEU, earnings exceed **$125M**.

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.0/10 — Many carriers and terminals expose event data. Optimization is well-understood. Biggest challenge is standardizing diverse free-time rules.

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Data gaps where terminals or carriers lack APIs; mitigated by EDI and manual upload fallbacks
  - Low: Legal/regulatory; demurrage is contractual, and disputes are normal business

  **Legal & Ethical:** Helps importers avoid unnecessary charges and ensures invoices are correct. Does not manipulate events; only optimizes pickup and dispute behavior within contracts.
