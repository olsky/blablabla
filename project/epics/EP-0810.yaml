title: AI-Directed Bunker Fuel Arbitrage & Hedging Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Bunker fuel is the single largest cost for shipping lines ($100B+ market). Prices vary by 20% across global ports (Singapore vs Rotterdam). This AI agent monitors global fuel spot prices, refinery output, and vessel routes. It autonomously dictates exactly where a fleet should refuel and executes high-frequency oil futures swaps to lock in the absolute lowest price 6 months in advance.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns a physical logistics fleet into a high-frequency commodities trading desk. Squeezing massive alpha out of the marine fuel market.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Refinery API integrations and commodities hedging ML).
  - Cash Out: 10% of the net fuel savings generated for the carrier.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Fuel Costs Hedged: $2,000,000,000\n  - Net Savings identified: $200,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Extreme volatility in oil markets causing margin calls on the hedging swaps.
  - Medium: Port congestion preventing a ship from reaching the 'cheap fuel' port in time.
  - Low: Carrier demand (Fuel cost is a board-level priority).
