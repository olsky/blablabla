title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Warehouse Egress & Storage
description: |
  **Idea:** Warehouses near major ports (LA/Long Beach) are chronically full, while nearby smaller warehouses sit half-empty. This platform tokenizes 'pallet slots' in warehouses. An AI monitors ship arrival schedules and inland truck demand. It algorithmically buys up excess warehouse egress (outbound) and storage capacity in bulk and re-sells it as a high-frequency liquid commodity to importers facing sudden port overflows.

  **Why "WOW":** Creating the 'Airbnb for Logistics Real Estate'. It turns rigid, fixed-lease warehouse space into a liquid, algorithmic yield asset.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (WMS (Warehouse Management System) API integrations and secondary market matching engine).
  - Cash Out: 15% platform fee on all secondary pallet-slot trades.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Pallet Slots Traded: 10,000,000\n  - Avg Slot Price: $80
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Liability for goods-in-transit being stored in unvetted third-party 'overflow' warehouses.
  - Medium: The manual nature of moving pallets physically (logistics friction).
  - Low: Warehouse owner demand (Anything to monetize dead space).
