title: "Warehouse Inventory Optimization & Shrinkage Detection"
description: |
  ML system for retail/logistics that predicts optimal inventory levels by location,
  predicts demand, and detects shrinkage anomalies (theft, damage, counting errors).
  Integrates with WMS (Warehouse Management Systems) like SAP Extended Warehouse Management,
  Oracle WMS. Reduces excess inventory by 20-30% and shrinkage by 40-60%.
problem_statement: |
  U.S. retail inventory shrinkage costs $100B+ annually (theft, damage, accounting errors).
  Most retailers can't pinpoint loss drivers; inventory is optimized for safety stock.
  Overstocking ties up $50B+ in excess working capital. No system-wide visibility into
  inventory movements across distribution network.
solution:
  approach: |
    WMS data ingest (inventory transactions, receipts, sales, adjustments) → Demand forecasting
    by SKU/location → Anomaly detection on inventory movements → Shrinkage clustering
    (by cause: theft pattern, seasonal damage, processing errors) → Recommendations for
    stock level optimization and loss prevention
  technical_stack:
    - Data: WMS APIs, POS feeds, receiving system data
    - ML: Demand forecasting (Prophet), anomaly detection (isolation forests)
    - Agents: Inventory rebalancing, shrinkage alerts
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-8K/month) + % of shrinkage reduction (10% of savings)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2600000

  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2281
feasibility_score: 8.8
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (WMS integration → demand forecasting → shrinkage detection → optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: WMS system fragmentation; mitigation = target top 50% (SAP, Oracle).
  Business: Retail margin pressure; mitigation = quick payoff story (weeks not months).
  Operational: Requires buy-in from supply chain teams; mitigation = pilot test.
