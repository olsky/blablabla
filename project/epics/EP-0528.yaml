title: Automated Geothermal Well Targeting API
description: |
  **Idea:** Geothermal energy is critical but exploration has a 40% failure rate (digging a $5M dry hole). This API processes raw satellite gravimetry, local seismology, and magnetic soil data through spatial ML to mathematically pinpoint the exact subsurface temperature gradients globally. Energy companies input a bounding box, and the API spits out a high-probability drill path and predicted gigawatt yield.

  **Why "WOW":** Turns extremely risky physical prospecting into a definitive software query. De-risks global clean energy.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Heavy ML on geospatial/seismic datasets).
  - Cash Out: $500k per confirmed target, or 1% royalty on the generated megawatts.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Targets Sold: 200
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Geological anomalies defeating the model.
  - Medium: Processing costs for massive seismic vectors.
  - Low: Market Need (Geothermal is booming).
