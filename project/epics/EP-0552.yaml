title: Autonomous Commercial Real Estate Tax Appeal Submitter
description: |
  **Idea:** Local municipalities routinely over-assess commercial real estate, forcing landlords to pay millions in excess property taxes. This system ingests county-level parcel data and recent closing-price APIs. It algorithmically detects when a skyscraper or mall is over-valued by the city tax assessor compared to comparable recent sales. It auto-generates a flawless, 40-page legal tax appeal document including all necessary localized comparables and submits it to the county via e-file API.

  **Why "WOW":** Infinite robot tax attorneys fighting city hall at scale. Recovers millions for property owners with zero human effort.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Parsing messy, fragmented county assessor APIs and auto-generating legal PDFs).
  - Cash Out: 30% contingency fee on the successfully abated tax amount for the landlord.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Properties Appealed: 25,000\n  - Total Tax Value Appealed: $2,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Municipalities passing laws to explicitly block algorithmic/automated tax appeal filings.
  - Medium: Accuracy of the 'comparable sales' algorithm in highly illiquid real estate markets.
  - Low: Landlord demand (Pure found money).
