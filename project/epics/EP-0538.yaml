title: Automated Biometric Privacy Compliance Shield
description: |
  **Idea:** New laws strictly penalize handling biometric data (FaceID, Voice). This proxy API sits between enterprise apps and the cloud. It intercepts raw biometric streams (video/audio from a user), uses edge-AI to irreversibly cryptographically hash the biometric features into a non-reversible vector, and sends ONLY the math vector to the enterprise. The enterprise never touches PII, achieving instant, automated HIPAA/BIPA compliance.

  **Why "WOW":** Absolute mathematical immunity from biometric privacy lawsuits for enterprises.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (Building the low-latency cryptographic edge-proxy).
  - Cash Out: Fraction of a cent per biometric API call processed.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - API Calls Processed: 50,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Latency introduced by the proxy ruining user login experiences.
  - Medium: Evolution of hashing standards to withstand quantum attacks.
  - Low: Sales friction (Compliance officers will force adoption).
