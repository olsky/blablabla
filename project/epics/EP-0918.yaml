title: Insurance Claims Fraud Ring Detection & Prevention Engine
description: Insurance fraud losses total $30–$50B annually. This AI system detects multi-person fraud rings by analyzing claim sequences, provider networks, claimant patterns, and temporal clustering. Organized fraud rings (40–60% of fraud) are invisible to traditional claim-by-claim analysis. System flags high-confidence rings, estimates fraud loss per ring, and recommends enforcement actions (claim denial, provider termination, LE referral). Revenue $50K–$200K per enterprise customer annually (saves $500K–$5M in avoided fines/year).

value_proposition: Detect multi-person, organized fraud rings before payout. Reduce claim investigation costs 80%. Identify provider networks supporting fraud. Improve claims accuracy and reduce claim fraud payout loss per customer from $500K to <$50K annually.

target_customer: Health insurers (UnitedHealth, Humana, Aetna, CVS, regional/state plans); Property & Casualty insurers (auto, home); Workers' compensation insurers; Third-party administrators (TPAs).

business_case:
  problem_statement: Insurance fraud is America's second-biggest crime after tax evasion. Estimated loss is $30–$50B/year in US alone (10–13% of total claims). 40–60% of fraud is organized (not individual). Current detection catches <10% of organized fraud. Investigation cost is $5–$15 per dollar recovered (negative ROI for small fraud). Current approach is claim-level rules + post-payment investigation (30–60 days late). No ring detection exists at scale.
  
  solution_approach: 1) Real-time claims data pipeline (claim detail, provider, claimant, diagnosis codes). 2) Feature engineering (claimant network graphs, temporal clustering, geographic hotspots). 3) Ring detection algorithm (unsupervised clustering; high confidence if >10 claimants + temporal overlap + geographic proximity). 4) Scoring confidence 0–100% based on ring size, procedure deviation, temporal clustering, financial volume, provider history. 5) Auto-recommend (deny >90% confidence, escalate 70–90%, monitor 50–70%, refer to LE if >$5M). 6) Outcome tracking feeds model improvement. 7) No human required; all algorithmic.
  
  target_metrics: Fraud detection rate 40–60% of organized fraud (vs. current 5–10%). False positive rate <5%. Cost avoidance $1–$3M per ring detected. Investigation resource efficiency 10x.
  
  assumptions: Claims data available in structured format (99% of insurers). Real-time or daily claim batch processing feasible. Ring patterns statistically detectable.
  
  revenue_model: Per-claim fee ($0.10–$0.50 per claim; $100K–$500K/year per insurer) OR success-based (5–20% of fraud prevented; $500K–$750K/year) OR hybrid freemium + premium. Recommended Model 2 (success-based); aligns incentives; scales to enterprise.
  
  product_roadmap: 'Phase 1 Weeks 1–8: MVP ring detection (FLSA data pipeline, feature engineering, clustering algorithm, API + recommendation engine). Phase 2 Weeks 9–12: Scale + integration (connect to insurer CRM, multi-insurer federation). Phase 3 Months 4–6: Predictive + expansion (predict rings 30–60 days prior; expand to P&C fraud; add insider fraud).'
  
  feasibility_score_narrative: Ring detection is proven pattern-matching problem. ML techniques standard. Claims data available and stable. No novel algorithms needed. Business risk medium (need 1–2 pilot insurers for proof).
  
  deployment_model: 'Option 1: SaaS (insurer sends data to system). Option 2: On-premise (in insurer VPC). Option 3: TPA partnership (inside TPA platform). Recommended: SaaS + TPA for distribution.'
  
  success_criteria: Detect 30%+ organized fraud losses. False positive rate <5%. Cost per ring <$50K. 5+ insurers @ $500K–$2M/year by Year 1.
  
  first_year_revenue_usd: 8500000
  first_year_user_count: 18
  users_acquisition_target: 18 to 25
  user_segment_distribution: Large insurers (UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS, Aetna) 3–5 @ $1.5M–$3M/year = $4.5M–$15M. Mid-tier insurers (regional, workers' comp) 8–12 @ $300K–$750K/year = $2.4M–$9M. TPA partnerships 2–3 @ $1M–$2M/year = $2M–$6M. Conservative Year 1 5 insurers @ $800K avg + 3 TPAs @ $600K = $5.8M. Realistic 8 insurers + 5 TPAs = $9.4M.
  
  revenue_trajectory: Month 1–2 MVP; Month 3 pilot customer $50K; Month 4 converts to $800K–$1M annual; Months 5–6 2–3 more customers ($2.5M–$3.5M); Months 7–9 4–6 total customers ($2.5M–$3.5M ARR); Months 10–12 8–10 customers ($6M–$8M ARR).
  
  roi_time_in_months: 4.5
  roi_rationale: Development $400K, sales $200K, infrastructure $100K = $700K breakeven. First revenue Month 3 ($50K pilot) → Month 12 ($1.5M–$2M cumulative). Month 4–5 first $800K annual contract → ROI positive. True ROI Month 4.5–5.
  
  implementation_timeline: 'Weeks 1–8 MVP (claims pipeline, rule engine, API, testing). Weeks 9–12 pilot prep (network insurers, finalize contract, integrate data). Month 4–5 pilot results + case study. Month 6–12 scale (10–20 customers, expand to P&C, TPA partnerships).'
  
  dependencies: Real claims data access (1–2 pilot insurers). Insurance IT partnerships (Guidewire, Salesforce). HIPAA business associate agreements.

feasibility_score: 8.7

risk_analysis: Technical (false positive rate >10% loses trust; mitigation conservative thresholds + review). Business (enterprises skeptical; mitigation lead with numbers). Data (missing claims, duplicates; mitigation validation pipeline). Legal (deny claims liability; mitigation recommends only, humans approve).
