title: Autonomous "Zero-Knowledge" Supply Chain Transparency Mesh
description: |
  **Idea:** A privacy-preserving platform that allows global supply chains (e.g., cobalt, coffee, textiles) to prove ethical sourcing (conflict-free, no labor violations) without exposing sensitive commercial relationships. The system uses autonomous agents that ingest data from IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and government import/export logs to generate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs of compliance.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (ZK-Circuit design for supply chain logic + Heterogeneous data ingestion).
  - Cash Out: Per-item or per-shippment verification fee ($0.05 - $10.00 depending on item value).
  
  **Projections:**
  - First-Year Earnings: $350,000 (Early pilot with luxury/high-impact brands).
  - First-Year Users: 10 Global Logistics/Brand partners.
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (ZK-proofs are computationally intensive and supply chain data is messy).
  
  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Garbage-In-Garbage-Out (IoT data can be faked at the physical source).
  - Medium: Regulatory shifts in ZK-technology acceptance.
