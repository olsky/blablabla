title: Predictive Crop-Failure Parametric Payout API (Global)
description: |
  **Idea:** Similar to the 500-series but scaled to the $100B institutional re-insurance level. This AI monitors global NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) satellite data. If a province-level crop index falls below the 10-year mean by >30%, the re-insurance contract autonomously pays out to the local national insurer, preventing a sovereign credit default.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the 'Algorithmic Safety Net' for global food security. It solves the national-level default risk of agriculture failures without a single human adjuster.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months ( NDVI satellite-data pipelines and sovereign re-insurance legal-wrappers).
  - Cash Out: 1% performance fee on the national-level re-insurance pools clearanced.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Sovereign Insurance Volume Cleared: $15,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A global 'Super-El-Nino' causing simultaneous crop failures on every continent, bankrupting the re-insurance pool.
  - Medium: Political manipulation of local 'Ground Truth' crop-data to trigger a false payout (system must be satellite-only).
  - Low: Sovereign Demand (Nations are desperate for predictable disaster-relief liquidity).
