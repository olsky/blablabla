title: "Video Content Engagement Prediction & Editing Optimization"
description: |
  ML system for video creators (YouTube, TikTok, streaming platforms) that predicts
  engagement (views, watch time, retention) based on video features (thumbnails,
  titles, editing style, topic, creator history). Recommends optimal editing, upload
  timing, and content strategy. Integrates with YouTube/TikTok analytics APIs.
problem_statement: |
  7M+ video creators compete for attention (200 hours uploaded per minute to YouTube).
  Most creators lack data-driven insights on what drives engagement. Editing/production
  is expensive and time-consuming (50% of creators outsource). A/B testing takes weeks;
  most micro-tactics go untested.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest creator analytics (historical video perf by views, watch time, demographics) →
    Extract features (thumbnail color, title sentiment, editing pace, topic embedding,
    creator metadata) → Build engagement prediction model per creator → Recommend
    thumbnail/title/editing changes → Track A/B outcome feedback
  technical_stack:
    - Data: YouTube API (analytics, search), TikTok API, thumbnail images (computer vision)
    - ML: Video feature extraction, engagement prediction (per-creator fine-tuning)
    - Agents: Recommendation engine, A/B testing orchestration
  revenue_model: "Freemium (basic analytics) + premium ($10-50/month for recommendations)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1800000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.6
  target_users_estimate: 12000
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 12
feasibility_score: 8.8
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (YouTube/TikTok API integration → feature extraction → engagement model → recommendations)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Creator API access varies by platform; mitigation = OAuth-based authentication.
  Business: High churn (creator attrition); mitigation = low friction pricing + community lock-in.
  Platform risk: YouTube/TikTok API access restrictions; mitigation = direct platform partnership.
