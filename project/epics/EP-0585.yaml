title: Predictive Utility Pole & Grid Degeneration Tracker
description: |
  **Idea:** Failing power lines cause catastrophic wildfires (PG&E). Sending humans to inspect 5 million poles is impossible. This system commands a fleet of autonomous, beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) drones. The drones use hyperspectral and thermal cameras to scan transmission lines. The edge-AI detects microscopic thermal anomalies (corroded splices) and acoustic arcing, mathematically predicting a line snap weeks in advance and automatically dispatching repair crews.

  **Why "WOW":** Prevents billion-dollar wildfires via autonomous aerial robotics and edge-predictive maintenance.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Deploying CV models onto edge-compute drone hardware and integrating with utility dispatch APIs).
  - Cash Out: SaaS: $200/mile inspected per year.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Miles of Transmission Line Monitored: 750,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: FAA regulations regarding continuous BVLOS drone operations spanning entire states.
  - Medium: Battery endurance / physical operation of drone fleets in harsh weather.
  - Low: Utility adoption (Wildfire liabilities are bankrupting them).
