title: Autonomous 'Trade-Based Money Laundering' (TBML) Scrubber
description: |
  **Idea:** Money is laundered by mis-invoicing trade goods (e.g. shipping $1 washcloths and invoicing them as $1,000 microchips). This AI agent monitors every trade invoice globally. It uses multi-modal LLMs to compare the invoice description to the actual market-price of the physical goods and autonomously blocks the transaction if the price-variance is >30%.

  **Why "WOW":** It prevents the world's most common form of money laundering via pure price-oracle supremacy. A super-human compliance officer for the $25 Trillion trade market.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the global SKU-price oracle and the trade-invoice NLP parser).
  - Cash Out: Taking a 0.25% 'Compliance Fee' on every trade cleared.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Gross Trade Volume Processed: $80,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Natural 'High-Variance' goods (Luxe art, specialized custom machinery) triggering constant false positives.
  - Medium: Gaining access to the 'Closed' private trade invoices of major corporations.
  - Low: Regulatory Pressure (TBML is the #1 focus of global financial task forces).
