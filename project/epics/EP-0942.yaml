title: "Software Bug Prediction & Code Review Automation Engine"
description: |
  ML system for development teams that predicts which code changes have highest
  defect risk before review/merge. Analyzes code diff patterns, author history,
  test coverage changes, and complexity metrics. Surfaces high-risk PRs for scrutiny;
  flags safe PRs for expedited merge. Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
problem_statement: |
  Bug detection costs enterprises $100B+ annually (rework, hotfixes, production incidents).
  Code review is bottleneck to velocity; most teams review all PRs uniformly regardless
  of risk. 80% of bugs come from 20% of changes (high-risk modifications). Risk is
  difficult to predict manually.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest code diffs → Extract features (cyclomatic complexity, file churn, author
    tenure, test delta, dep changes) → Predict defect likelihood → Risk-stratified
    review recommendations → Correlate with post-merge outcomes → Retrain continuously
  technical_stack:
    - Data: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket APIs, code analysis (static), test coverage
    - ML: Gradient boosting for risk prediction, unsupervised clustering for similar risks
    - Integration: PR plugins, Slack notifications for high-risk changes
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-10K/month per team based on commit volume) + potential integration revenue"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2200000
  roi_time_in_months: 0.9
  target_users_estimate: 110
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1667
feasibility_score: 9.2
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "7 weeks (GitHub API integration → feature extraction → defect prediction model → PR integration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Code feature extraction complexity; mitigation = leverage open-source tools (CodeClimate API).
  Business: Code review decisions are org-specific; mitigation = transparent scoring + configurable thresholds.
  Adoption: Requires dev culture buy-in; mitigation = show velocity wins in pilot.
review_policy:
  min_reviews: 2
  approval_threshold: 0.75
  require_blocking_clearance: false
