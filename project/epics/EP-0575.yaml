title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Water Desalination Capacity
description: |
  **Idea:** Desalination plants (Middle East, California) run at constant baseloads despite fluctuating water demand. This system ingests local municipal water reservoir levels and agricultural drought telemetry. It establishes an active spot market where water-heavy industries (semiconductor fabs, data centers) can algorithmically bid on massive blocks of excess desalinated water capacity hours before it is produced, optimizing the plant's yield mathematically.

  **Why "WOW":** Turns baseline utility infrastructure into a dynamic algorithmic trading platform for fresh water.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Integrating with proprietary SCADA systems at major desalination hubs).
  - Cash Out: 2% transaction fee on the water-volume contracts cleared.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Water Volume Cleared: 500 Billion Gallons
  - Estimated Revenue: $110,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Physical pipe limitations preventing algorithmic routing of the purchased water.
  - Medium: Government intervention in pricing essential water resources.
  - Low: Industrial demand (Fabs need guaranteed water to survive).
