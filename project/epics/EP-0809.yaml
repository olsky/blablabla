title: Algorithmic Carbon-Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) Compliance Bot
description: |
  **Idea:** Beginning 2026, the EU will charge massive 'carbon tariffs' on imports (Steel, Cement, Aluminum). Every importer must provide a detailed 'Carbon Passport.' This system autonomously calculates the carbon footprint of an imported product by ingesting the overseas factory's energy bills and bill-of-materials from the ERP. It generates the legally required CBAM declaration and autonomously purchases the exact amount of EU-ETS carbon permits to clear the border.

  **Why "WOW":** The ultimate solution for the 'Green Wall' around Europe. It automates the trillion-dollar intersection of global climate policy and trade logistics.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Building the carbon-accounting graph models and integrating with the EU-ETS carbon trading API).
  - Cash Out: Toll of $500 per successfully generated and cleared CBAM Carbon Passport.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Carbon Passports Cleared: 250,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The EU changing the 'Emissions Factors' rules suddenly, making the AI's calculation medically inaccurate in a legal sense.
  - Medium: Overseas factories refusing to provide the granular energy data required for the calculation.
  - Low: Mandatory Regulation (You cannot sell into Europe without this; adoption is 100%).
