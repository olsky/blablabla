title: Autonomous Rare-Disease Real-World Evidence Reimbursement Uplift Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Orphan-drug manufacturers and payers struggle to justify reimbursement with limited trial data. This engine ingests de-identified EHR episodes, claims, lab values, PROs (patient-reported outcomes), and registry data to autonomously construct indication-specific real-world evidence dossiers. Agents generate payer-facing outcomes models, auto-draft reimbursement submissions, and monitor post-launch outcomes for renegotiation triggers.

  **Why "WOW":** Speeds market access and price justification for rare therapies while giving payers higher confidence—reducing manual HEOR analyst effort.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 months (data normalization, outcomes modeling, payer submission templates).
  - Cash Out: engagement fee + success-based uplift share on approved price corridors.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Orphan Products Supported: 35
  - Average Uplift Fees per Product: $500,000
  - Uplift Share Revenue: $12,250,000
  - Platform Revenue: $3,850,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $16,100,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Data privacy; mitigated via strict de-identification, DUA compliance, and secure enclaves.
  - Medium: Payer skepticism of AI-generated evidence; mitigated with transparent methodology and human HEOR oversight gates.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Fully compliant with GDPR/health privacy; transparent statistical methods; no fabricated evidence.
