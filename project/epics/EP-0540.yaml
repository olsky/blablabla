title: Pre-Emptive Cyber-Ransomware Negotiation & Settlement Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** When ransomware hits, paralyzed hospitals/corps waste days finding crypto and negotiating, risking lives. This system is a dormant smart-contract and automated negotiator. For insured clients, when a known ransomware strain locks a network, the agent autonomously validates the decryptor key mathematically via zero-knowledge proofs on a test file, algorithmically negotiates the ransom down based on historical threat-actor profiles, and instantly clears the crypto payment to restore the network in minutes, not weeks.

  **Why "WOW":** Removes the chaos and human emotion from ransomware. Treats cyber-extortion as an automated, friction-less math/business transaction.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Mapping Threat Actor behavior profiles, building secure ZK-proof escrow protocols).
  - Cash Out: 15% of the negotiated saving off the initial ransom demand, plus standard retainer.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Incidents Handled: 5,000\n  - Avg Savings/Fee: $25k
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: US Treasury/OFAC sanctions making it illegal to pay certain threat actors algorithmically.
  - Medium: Threat actors refusing to use the algorithmic escrow.
  - Low: Technical execution of the ZK-proof.
