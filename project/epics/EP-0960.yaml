title: "Real Estate Property Management Predictive Maintenance"
description: |
  ML system for property managers/REITs that predicts building system failures (HVAC,
  plumbing, electrical, roof) before they occur. Prioritizes maintenance by criticality.
  Reduces emergency maintenance 40-70% and tenant complaints 30-50%. Integrates with
  building management systems (BMS) and CMMS.
problem_statement: |
  $100B+ spent on commercial building maintenance annually; 60-70% is reactive/emergency.
  Emergency repairs cost 3-5x preventive maintenance. Tenant churn due to building
  issues costs landlords 15-25% of rental income. Most buildings lack predictive capability.
solution:
  approach: |
    BMS data ingest (HVAC temps, water flow, electrical consumption, humidity) →
    Anomaly detection → Component failure prediction (HVAC coil fouling, pipe corrosion,
    roof degradation) → Maintenance priority scoring → Service scheduling → Tenant
    communication orchestration
  technical_stack:
    - Data: BMS APIs (Johnson Controls, Honeywell, Siemens), maintenance databases
    - ML: Time series anomaly detection, failure prediction
    - Agents: Maintenance scheduling, vendor coordination, tenant notifications
  revenue_model: "SaaS per building ($500-2K/month) + % of avoided emergency costs (10-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1700000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 220
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 643
feasibility_score: 8.4
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (BMS integration → anomaly detection → failure models → scheduling)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: BMS system variety; mitigation = support top 5 vendors.
  Operational: Property managers slow to adopt new tech; mitigation = simple UI + value demonstrations.
  Safety: HVAC/electrical issues are safety-critical; mitigation = conservative thresholds.
