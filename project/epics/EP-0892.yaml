title: Autonomous 'Privacy-Preserving' Compliance Cross-Check (ZK)
description: |
  **Idea:** Banks want to share data on 'Dirty Money' but can't due to privacy laws. This AI agent builds a 'Zero-Knowledge' compliance network. Banks stream their 'Suspicious Activity' metadata. The AI uses ZK-proofs to find 'Common Criminals' across 10 different banks without any bank ever seeing another bank's private customer data. it autonomously issues a 'Network-Alert' to all 10 banks simultaneously.

  **Why "WOW":** It breaks the 'Privacy-Compliance Paradox' mathematically. It solves the biggest bottleneck in global AML via autonomous Zero-Knowledge proofing.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Writing complex ZK-circuits (Circom) and building the secure cross-bank peer-to-peer network).
  - Cash Out: $10k/month per bank in the network + $100 per successful 'criminal-match' found.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Member Banks: 1,000\n  - Matches Found: 500,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $170,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Mathematical vulnerabilities in the ZK-circuit that allow a 'leak' of private banking data (Catastrophic legal liability).
  - Medium: Regulatory pushback on 'Shared AML data' even if cryptographically secure.
  - Low: Bank Demand (They are losing billions to criminals who jump from bank to bank).
