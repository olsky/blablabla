title: Predictive Wildfire-Risk Underwriting API for Real Estate
description: |
  **Idea:** Insurers are fleeing California/Australia due to wildfire risk. This AI agent uses hyper-spectral satellite data and soil-moisture APIs to provide a 'Daily Wildfire Risk' score for every single home. it offers a dynamic, daily-priced insurance product that only charges the homeowner when the local risk exceeds a specific threshold, making insurance affordable again.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the 'Real-Time Actuary' for a burning world. It solves the un-insurability crisis via high-frequency, satellite-driven dynamic pricing.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Ingesting satellite moisture data and building the wildfire-spread GNN).
  - Cash Out: Daily premium float + 15% underwriting spread.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Homes Under Protection: 1,000,000\n  - Avg Daily Premium: $0.80
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A 'Firestorm' event that leaps across all predictive containment models, causing catastrophic loss.
  - Medium: Homeowners forgetting to 'Enable' the daily insurance when the AI flags high risk.
  - Low: Desperate Demand (People cannot get mortgages without insurance; they need this solution).
