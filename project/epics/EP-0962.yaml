title: "SaaS Customer Expansion Opportunity Scoring & Upsell Engine"
description: |
  ML system for SaaS companies that identifies expansion/upsell opportunities within
  existing customers by analyzing product usage, company growth signals, and feature adoption.
  Recommends targeted feature bundling and pricing changes. Increases ARR per customer by 30-50%.
problem_statement: |
  SaaS expansion revenue (net revenue retention >120%) is 3-5x more profitable than new
  customer acquisition. Yet most SaaS companies leave 40-50% of expansion revenue on the
  table (unused features, sub-optimized pricing). Expansion is identified reactively
  (sales calls) not proactively.
solution:
  approach: |
    Product usage ingest (feature adoption, usage volume, login frequency) + Company
    data (employee growth, funding, public company data) → Expansion indicator modeling →
    Customer segmentation (by expansion potential) → Recommendation engine (upsell features,
    tier upgrade, add-on products) → Sales/CS handoff orchestration → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Product analytics APIs (Mixpanel, Amplitude), billing systems, CRM
    - ML: Expansion likelihood scoring, feature recommendation, price optimization
    - Agents: Alert generation, deal desk recommendations, monitoring
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-8K/month) + % of incremental ARR (5-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 75
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3467
feasibility_score: 9.0
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Mixpanel/Amplitude integration → company data onboarding → scoring model → sales integration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Product analytics API variety; mitigation = support top 5 platforms.
  Business: Sales resistance to automation; mitigation = position as CS acceleration tool.
  Adoption: Requires CRM integration; mitigation = pre-built Salesforce connectors.
