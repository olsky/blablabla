title: Algorithmic Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) Yield Ledger
description: |
  **Idea:** Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities produce expensive carbon credits, but verifiable off-take agreements are messy. This system connects directly to the IoT exhaust valves of DAC plants. For every ton of CO2 physically pumped underground, the system algorithmically mints a verifiable "Ton-Stored" token. It then dynamically routes and sells these tokens instantly to corporate ESG buyers (Stripe, Microsoft) via an automated API exchange based on real-time spot carbon pricing.

  **Why "WOW":** Zero-trust, mathematically verified carbon offsets tied to physical machine telemetry. Institutional grade climate finance.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2 months (IoT integration securely to DAC facilities, building the matching exchange).
  - Cash Out: 2% transparent clearing fee on tokenized carbon traded.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Carbon value cleared: $5,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Lack of scale in physical DAC infrastructure to provide token supply.
  - Medium: Verifying long-term geological storage permanence.
  - Low: Corporate demand for high-quality verifiable offsets.
