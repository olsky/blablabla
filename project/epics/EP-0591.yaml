title: Algorithmic Commercial Drone Delivery Interdiction & Routing
description: |
  **Idea:** When millions of delivery drones (Amazon, FedEx) share the 400ft sky, collisions are imminent. This system is the automated air-traffic controller. It acts as a central API clearinghouse. Drones submit their intended 3D vector paths. The algorithm calculates complex fluid dynamics (wake turbulence) and predicts intersection paths in 4D space. It natively issues micro-course corrections to competing corporate drones in milliseconds, preventing disaster without human operators.

  **Why "WOW":** The algorithmic maestro of the low-altitude logistics economy. Mathematical air traffic control.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Writing extremely low-latency 4D collision avoidance math and establishing the central API exchange).
  - Cash Out: Micro-toll ($0.05) per drone flight vector cleared.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Flights Cleared: 2,500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $125,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A latency spike causing a high-speed drone collision over a populated urban center (Massive liability).
  - Medium: Forcing intensely competitive mega-corps (Amazon/Google) to share their proprietary drone telemetry with a central API.
  - Low: Regulatory mandate (The FAA will demand a system like this).
