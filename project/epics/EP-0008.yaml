title: Deep-Fake Audio Forensic Detection API Pipeline
description: |
  **Idea:** With the proliferation of hyper-realistic AI voice cloning (e.g., ElevenLabs) used for banking fraud and political manipulation, this API serves as a forensic shield. B2B clients (Banks, Call Centers, Social Media networks) stream incoming audio to the API. The system autonomously runs the audio through an ensemble of specifically trained neural networks that don't listen to the words, but look for the spectral frequency artifacts and breathing-pattern anomalies indicative of diffusion/transformer generated audio. It returns a pure JSON confidence score in under 200ms.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8-10 weeks to train the ensemble models on vast datasets of real vs. cloned audio to achieve high F1 scores, and to optimize the API for ultra-low latency.
  - Cash Out: Metred API usage (per minute of audio processed).
  
  **First Year Projections:**
  - API Integration Clients (Banks/Telecoms): 8
  - Audio Minutes Processed: 5,000,000
  - Estimated Earnings: $250,000
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (Requires specialized knowledge in DSP - Digital Signal Processing and advanced ML).
  
  **Risk Analysis:** 
  - High Technical Risk: Constant cat-and-mouse game. As generative voice models improve, the detection models must be continuously retrained. False negatives in a banking environment carry massive liability.
