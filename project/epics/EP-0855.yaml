title: Generative Actuarial 'Loss-Model' Stress-Tester
description: |
  **Idea:** Insurers fail because their 'Loss Models' don't account for emergent AI risks. This system is a 'Red-Team' actuary. It uses LLMs to generate 100,000 'impossible' loss scenarios (e.g. fleet-wide autonomous car hack during a hurricane) and stresses the insurer's current capital reserves via API, and autonomously suggests specific re-insurance hedging trades.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the first 'AI Stress-Test' for the $6T insurance industry. It identifies bankruptcy-level risks that human actuaries can't even imagine.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Developing the generative scenario-model and the actuarial-math stress-test engine).
  - Cash Out: Enterprise SaaS ($250k/year per major insurance carrier).

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Institutional Clients: 600
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The AI missing a truly obvious scenario, giving the insurer a 'False Sense of Security' before a crash.
  - Medium: Complexity of modeling multi-domain correlated failures in legacy software environments.
  - Low: Regulatory Mandate (Solvency testing is a legal requirement for insurers).
