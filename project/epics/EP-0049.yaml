title: Autonomous Drug-Drug Interaction Signal Detection Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** The FDA's FAERS (Adverse Event Reporting System) database receives 2M+ reports per year, yet it takes months or years for novel drug-drug interaction (DDI) signals to be recognized and acted upon. This platform builds an autonomous signal detection engine that: (1) continuously ingests FAERS, EMA EudraVigilance, and scientific literature (PubMed) using NLP agents, (2) applies disproportionality analysis and Bayesian confidence scoring to identify statistically significant emerging DDI signals, (3) cross-references against the DrugBank interaction database to flag novel, previously-undocumented interactions, and (4) delivers structured weekly signal reports via API to pharmaceutical pharmacovigilance teams, hospital pharmacy systems, and EHR vendors. Each signal report includes drug pair, affected population segment, severity score, evidence quality, and recommended monitoring protocol.

  **Why "WOW":** Every pharma company with a marketed drug is legally required to maintain pharmacovigilance. This replaces an entire team of safety analysts for a fraction of the cost. Hospital pharmacy systems that integrate this could prevent thousands of adverse events annually.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~7 months (FAERS + literature NLP pipeline, statistical signal detection engine, DrugBank integration, report generation).
  - Cash Out: $5,000-$50,000/month per pharma client depending on portfolio size.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Pharma Company Subscribers: 60
  - Hospital Network / EHR Partners: 15
  - Average Revenue per Client: $22,000/month
  - Estimated Earnings: $18,900,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10 (FAERS and PubMed are open public APIs; disproportionality analysis algorithms (PRR, ROR) are well-published. Challenge is achieving signal sensitivity without excessive noise.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Regulatory risk if a signal is missed and causes patient harm; mitigated by positioning as a "signal detection aid" not a regulatory decision system, with explicit human pharmacovigilance review gate.
  - Medium: Scientific credibility requires validation against historical known DDIs before commercial launch.
  - Low: Technical complexity of NLP pipeline.
