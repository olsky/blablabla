title: Autonomous Marine Cargo Spoilage & Delay Parametric Insurance
description: Ingests real-time IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity) from shipping containers and GPS/AIS data. If temperature exceeds a threshold for a set duration or arrival is delayed past a certain date, a smart contract automatically pays out to the cargo owner.
