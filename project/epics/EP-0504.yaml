title: Autonomous Global Escheatment/Unclaimed Property Sweeper API
description: |
  **Idea:** Globally, over $100B in unclaimed property (dormant bank accounts, uncashed 401(k) checks, lost life insurance) sits in state and national treasuries. Claiming it requires navigating 1000s of different legacy government portals, PDF forms, and notary requirements. This API integrates with enterprise HR systems (Workday, ADP) and wealth managers. When an employee/client is onboarded, it autonomously queries every global escheatment database using regex-optimized fuzzy matching. When matches are found, LLMs auto-fill the required claim PDFs, integrate with digital e-notary APIs, and submit the claim via Selenium-driven RPA or government APIs.

  **Why "WOW":** It's literally free money for people and the enterprise. An enterprise can flip a switch and instantly recover millions for their employees as a massive, zero-cost perk. We take a micro-commission on recovered funds.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the global state/national treasury web-scraper and API aggregation layer, plus the PDF auto-fill/e-notary pipeline).
  - Cash Out: 5% finder's fee on all successfully recovered capital.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Users Scanned: 10,000,000 (via B2B integrations).
  - Estimated Recovery: $2,000,000,000.
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000.

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Government sites are notoriously brittle, requiring robust RPA and error handling, but the data is public domain by law).

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Changing anti-bot protections on legacy government websites (requires constant scraper maintenance).
  - Medium: Evolving regulations around third-party claim submissions (we mitigate by acting purely as a B2B white-label API).
  - Low: Finding matches (The probability is extremely high over a large enough B2B user base).
