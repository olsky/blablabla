title: Programmatic Satellite Imagery Crop-Yield Data Feeds
description: |
  **Idea:** A fully automated data pipeline targeting agricultural commodities traders. The system connects to public multi-spectral satellite imagery APIs (like Sentinel-2 or Landsat). It autonomously pulls daily images of major global crop-belts (e.g., soybeans in Brazil, wheat in Ukraine). It runs specialized computer vision models (NDVI - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to assess crop health and mathematically predict yield variances weeks before official government agricultural reports are released. This predictive JSON data is sold to hedge funds.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~12 weeks to build the geospatial data ingestion pipeline and tune the computer vision models to account for cloud cover and seasonal variances.
  - Cash Out: Extremely high-value data subscriptions for financial institutions.
  
  **First Year Projections:**
  - Hedge Fund Data Subscribers: 5
  - Estimated Earnings: $300,000+ ($5k/mo per fund)
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 6/10 (Geospatial data is famously massive, expensive to process, and requires specialized GIS data engineers).
  
  **Risk Analysis:** 
  - Low Legal Risk: Satellite data is public.
  - High Commercial Risk: If the yield predictions are statistically flawed, hedge funds will cancel subscriptions immediately. Accuracy is paramount.
