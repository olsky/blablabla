title: Predictive Industrial Methane Leak Bounty API
description: |
  **Idea:** Methane leaks from oil/gas pipelines are catastrophic for the climate, and companies face massive EPA fines if caught. However, leaks are invisible and remote. This system ingests orbital spectroscopy (satellites that can 'see' invisible gases) from the entire globe daily. It uses CV to pinpoint exact pipeline leaks down to the meter. It then autonomously acts as an algorithmic bounty hunter. It issues a private API call to the offending Oil Major (Exxon/BP): 'Pay us $5M instantly for the exact coordinates of this leak, or we automatically forward the data to the EPA for a $50M fine.'

  **Why "WOW":** Automated, highly aggressive environmental compliance via algorithmic extortion. It literally turns invisible pollution into instant, massive revenue.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Ingesting and parsing massive hyperspectral satellite cubes optimized for CH4 signatures).
  - Cash Out: The $5M+ 'Information Bounties' paid by massive energy companies to avoid catastrophic fines and PR disasters.

  **First Year Projections (US$1B Scale):**
  - Major Leaks Identified/Bountied: 250
  - Estimated Revenue: $1,250,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Oil Majors suing the startup under extortion statutes (Requires incredibly careful, legally-vetted 'Bounty/Service' phrasing).
  - Medium: Cloud cover preventing the satellites from verifying the leak.
  - Low: Data Availability (Methane-detecting satellites like MethaneSAT are fully operational).
