title: Algorithmic Dark Pool for B2B API Compute
description: |
  **Idea:** Companies pay exorbitant spot rates to AWS/GCP for burst compute. Most enterprises over-provision. This is a stealth dark pool exchange for B2B Kubernetes clusters. If Company A has a cluster sitting idle at 30%, the system autonomously routes Company B's encrypted Docker workloads to Company A's cluster based on real-time micro-penny BGP pricing. Zero cloud lock-in, acting entirely outside hyperscaler view.

  **Why "WOW":** Subverts AWS entirely. Turns the internet's scattered enterprise servers into a unified, massive, zero-margin dark pool supercomputer.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the peer-to-peer workload scheduler and secure enclave wrapper).
  - Cash Out: 2% clearing fee on decentralized compute volume.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Nodes Participated: 50,000\n  - Volume Traded: $8,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $160,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Corporate InfoSec restricting external workloads.
  - Medium: Latency guarantees over public internet.
  - Low: Adoption (Massive cost savings guarantee usage).
