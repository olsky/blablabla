title: "Poultry Contract Pricing & Margin Intelligence Engine"
description: |
  Autonomous agent analyzing historical contract terms, commodity costs, and
  integrator cost structures to recommend optimal pricing for new grower contracts.
  Predicts negotiation positions and identifies margin leakage across the supply chain.
problem_statement: |
  Poultry contracts between integrators and contract growers are complex and
  opaque. Grower margins are often negative due to commodity price volatility and
  poor contract terms. Integrators struggle to balance competitiveness with
  profitability. Better contract intelligence could unlock $500M+ in supply-chain
  value. Current negotiation is adversarial and information-asymmetric.
solution:
  approach: |
    Build database of historical contract terms (chick costs, feed quality
    provisions, mortality thresholds, payment timelines). Ingest commodity prices,
    integrator cost structures, and grower operating costs. Agent recommends contract
    terms balancing grower sustainability with integrator profitability. Identifies
    margin leakage and arbitrage opportunities.
  technical_stack: |
    Contract database (from integrators, grower organizations), commodity price
    APIs, cost accounting data, benchmarking analytics.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per integrator ($8K-25K/month) + contingent success fee (1-3% of contract
    margin improvements).

implementation_timeline: "MVP: 10 weeks. Full: 14 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Contract data access limited; mitigation: partner with integrators
  directly. Business: Sensitive data (cost structures); mitigation: anonymize and
  aggregate benchmark data.
