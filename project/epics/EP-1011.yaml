title: "Poultry Flock Health Early-Warning & Mortality Autopilot"
description: |
  An agent-driven service that ingests existing barn telemetry, feed logs, and
  processing plant condemn data to predict flock health events 7-21 days early
  and automatically optimize feed, ventilation setpoints, and shipment timing.
  Targets integrators and contract growers to reduce mortality and improve feed
  conversion without new hardware.
problem_statement: |
  Poultry producers lose billions annually from preventable mortality, suboptimal
  feed conversion, and late detection of health issues. A 1% increase in mortality
  or a 0.05 degradation in feed conversion ratio can erase margins for integrators.
  Current monitoring is reactive, relies on manual checks, and misses weak signals
  across barns and flocks.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest existing data from barn controllers, feed delivery systems, and
    processing plant outcomes. Build flock-level risk scores with time-series
    anomaly detection and causal factors (feed, temperature, humidity, stocking
    density). Agents propose and execute parameter changes through controller APIs
    and schedule proactive veterinary checks or shipment adjustments.
  technical_stack: |
    Barn controller APIs (e.g., humidity/temperature/ventilation), feed mill
    delivery logs, processing plant QA systems, time-series ML (XGBoost + LSTM),
    orchestration via event-driven pipelines and policy rules.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per complex ($2K-6K/month) + performance fee (5-8% of mortality and feed
    cost savings), with guaranteed ROI benchmarks.

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 8 weeks. Full: 12 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Data quality varies by integrator; mitigation: baseline calibration
  and adaptive thresholds per farm. Business: Grower trust in automated changes;
  mitigation: recommend-only mode first, then staged automation with approvals.
