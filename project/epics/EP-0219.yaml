title: Autonomous Used Car Residual Value & Depreciation Insurance
description: A parametric insurance product for auto lenders and leasing companies. The system ingests real-time used car auction data. If the average residual value for a specific model (e.g., a 3-year-old Tesla Model 3) drops below a pre-agreed floor, the policy automatically pays out to cover the lender's excess depreciation loss.

  compliance_risks: "Must partner with a licensed insurance/reinsurance carrier to legally structure and sell the policies."
