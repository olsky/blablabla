title: "Energy Grid Load Forecasting & Demand Response Automation"
description: |
  ML system for utility companies and grid operators that predicts electricity demand
  4-24 hours ahead with 95%+ accuracy. Autonomously orchestrates demand response programs
  (pricing signals, EV charging deferral, industrial load shedding) to avoid brownouts
  and optimize renewable utilization. Integrates with SCADA, AMI (smart meter) systems.
problem_statement: |
  $400B+ annual U.S. electricity market; grid instability costs $50-100B in outages + lost
  production. Renewable energy variability (solar, wind) makes forecasting critical. Most
  utilities use statistical models; neural approaches are underutilized. Demand response
  is mostly manual (text alerts); no granular automated control.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest AMI data (smart meter loads) + renewable generation forecasts (solar irradiance,
    wind speed) + temperature/weather → Build hierarchical load forecast (distribution,
    transmission, customer segment) → Demand response optimization (price elasticity
    models) → Auto-control signals (EV chargers, HVAC thermostats, industrial loads) →
    Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: AMI/SCADA systems, weather APIs, renewable generation forecasts
    - ML: Neural networks (LSTM) for load forecasting, optimization for demand response
    - Control: SCADA integration, OpenADR (open demand response) protocol
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($50K-200K per utility/region) + % of avoided outage costs"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2900000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.2
  target_users_estimate: 18
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 13444
status: draft
feasibility_score: 8.2
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (AMI/SCADA integration → load forecasting → demand response optimization → control integration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legacy SCADA systems; mitigation = support multiple protocols (Modbus, DNP3).
  Regulatory: Grid reliability is regulated (WECC, NERC); mitigation = conservative defaults + audits.
  Operational: Blackout risk; mitigation = human override + fail-safe defaults.
