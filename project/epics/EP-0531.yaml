title: Generative Enzyme Designer for Industrial Plastic Degradation
description: |
  **Idea:** The world is choking on PET plastic. This system uses AlphaFold-like generative biology to continuously design novel extremophile enzymes that can digest specific commercial plastics in hours rather than centuries. It runs the molecular dynamic simulations and patents the most aggressive enzyme sequences, licensing the blueprints to waste management mega-corps.

  **Why "WOW":** Solves the global plastic crisis via generative biology IP generation. In silico design of world-saving molecules.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Generative molecular biology model training).
  - Cash Out: Massive IP licensing upfronts + tonnage royalties.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Patents Granted: 15\n  - Licenses Sold: 5 at $30M
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Physical synthesis of the designed enzyme failing to match simulation kinetics.
  - Medium: Patent defense against biotech giants.
  - Low: Market demand (ESG mandates make this priceless).
