title: AI-Driven Real-Time Sanctions Screening-as-an-Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Global banks and trade hubs spend billions manually screening for sanctioned individuals and entities. This system acts as a sub-second cryptographic oracle. It ingest global sanction lists, corporate registers of shell companies, and social graph data. It provides a real-time 'Risk-of-Sanction' score via API for every counterparty in a trade transaction, using ZK-proofs to verify entity clean-status without exposing private trade details.

  **Why "WOW":** Eliminates the 'Sanctions False Positive' problem that causes 90% of trade delays. It provides sub-second institutional-grade compliance for the entire $25T trade market.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2.5 months (Pipelining global sanction firehoses and building the ZK-identity proofing layer).
  - Cash Out: $1.00 per API call across millions of daily trade packets.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Transactions Screened: 150,000,000\n  - Enterprise Banking Clients: 45
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: A 'Black Swan' event where a sanctioned entity bypasses the AI graph analysis, leading to catastrophic fines for the bank.
  - Medium: Varying definitions of sanctions across jurisdictions (US vs EU vs Asia).
  - Low: Compliance is legally mandatory (non-discretionary spend).
