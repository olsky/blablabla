title: Autonomous Wealth-Gap Discovery & Tax-Arbitrage Agent
description: |
  **Idea:** Corporations and family offices lose millions because they don't have the real-time compute to track every global tax treaty. This AI agent ingests the entity's global transaction flow and every active double-taxation treaty (DTA). It identifies 'High-Efficiency Windows' where shifting a specific dividend or royalty through a specific jurisdiction (e.g., Ireland to Luxembourg to Singapore) for 24 hours yields a 10% tax saving, and autonomously executes the movements via API.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns the global tax treaty network into a high-frequency algorithmic yield market. It provides a 'Big-Law Tax Partner' expertise at sub-second speed.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~4 months (Complex legal-NLP for global tax treaties and building the secure bank-API movement rails).
  - Cash Out: 20% cut of the successfully generated tax savings.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Tax Savings Generated: $1,250,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $250,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Governments (OECD) passing 'Anti-Avoidance' laws that retroactively criminalize algorithmic tax-treaty hopping.
  - Medium: Execution errors in shifting capital across jurisdictions leading to localized 'tax trap' freezes.
  - Low: Corporate Demand (CFOs are measured purely on Net Margin).
