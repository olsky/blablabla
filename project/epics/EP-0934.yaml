title: "Content Moderation at Scale - Policy Enforcement Agent"
description: |
  Autonomous agent that detects policy violations (hate speech, spam, adult content,
  misinformation) across social platforms, forums, UGC marketplaces using multimodal ML
  (text, image, video). Enforces policies at zero-marginal cost. Integrates via webhooks
  to Discord, Reddit, TikTok creator networks, Shopify. Blocks/flags 95%+ violations before
  human review.
problem_statement: |
  Content moderation costs platforms $2B+ annually; human moderators ($15-25/hr) review
  millions of pieces daily. Most platforms force creators to manually remove violations,
  creating trust/safety liability. Moderation inconsistency yields 30%+ appeals.
  Emerging platforms (Discord servers, creator networks) lack moderation entirely.
solution:
  approach: |
    Content ingest (webhook stream) → Multi-modal feature extraction (text embeddings,
    image classifiers, audio transcription) → Policy violation prediction (ensemble
    models) → Auto-action (delete, flag, notify) → Human-in-loop for edge cases →
    Outcome feedback for continuous improvement
  technical_stack:
    - Models: OpenAI Whisper (audio), Vision transformers, text classifiers
    - Data: Webhook ingest, S3/CDN for media storage
    - Orchestration: Async workers, policy rule engine
    - Integrations: Discord, Reddit, Shopify APIs
  revenue_model: "Per-action fees ($0.001-0.01 per item moderated) + platform licensing"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2700000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.4
  target_users_estimate: 180
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1250
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Webhook integration → feature extraction → ML model training → policy engine → integrations)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Model bias toward minority content; mitigation = diverse training data + bias audits.
  Legal: Moderation decisions are legally complex; mitigation = transparent + human override.
  Business: Platform moderation is commodity; mitigation = focus on cost reduction vs. competition.
