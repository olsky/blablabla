title: "Telecom Network Failover Optimization & Prediction Engine"
description: |
  ML system that predicts telecom network failures (cell tower outages, fiber cuts,
  switching failures) 4-24 hours in advance by analyzing network telemetry (latency,
  packet loss, jitter, signal strength). Autonomously orchestrates failovers to minimize
  service disruption. Integrates with NSN, Ericsson, Cisco network management APIs.
problem_statement: |
  Telecom service disruptions cost carriers $10B+ annually in SLA penalties,
  customer churn, and emergency maintenance. Network outages also trigger emergency
  calls to 911 (life-safety risk). Most carriers react to failures; predictive
  prevention doesn't exist at scale.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest network KPIs (throughput, latency, packet loss, signal metrics) → Detect
    anomalies (time series models) → Predict failure risk → Trigger failover agents
    (reroute traffic, activate backup capacity) → Coordinate with oncall teams →
    Track SLA impact
  technical_stack:
    - Data: NSN/Ericsson/Cisco management APIs (streaming KPIs)
    - ML: Time series anomaly detection, failure prediction (gradient boosting on antecedents)
    - Orchestration: Failover automation (API-driven), traffic steering
  revenue_model: "SaaS per market/region ($20K-50K/month) + % of prevented SLA penalties (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 3400000
  roi_time_in_months: 0.9
  target_users_estimate: 35
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 8095
feasibility_score: 8.3
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (NSN/Ericsson API integration → KPI pipeline → anomaly detection → failover agents)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legacy network equipment proprietary APIs; mitigation = target modern carriers first.
  Operational: Safety-critical (911 implications); mitigation = extensive testing + conservative defaults.
  Regulatory: Telecom regulations on service reliability; mitigation = audit compliance explicitly.
