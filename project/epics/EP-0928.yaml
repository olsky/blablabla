title: "Multi-Cloud Reserved Instance Optimizer"
description: |
  AI agent that continuously monitors compute usage across AWS, GCP, Azure,
  and hybrid environments. Predicts capacity needs, recommends reserved instances
  vs. spot vs. on-demand, and orchestrates purchases to maximize savings while
  maintaining 99.9% uptime SLA. Leverages native cloud APIs (CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Monitor).
problem_statement: |
  $60B+ annual cloud spend wasted on suboptimal instance selection. Most companies
  use default on-demand pricing; only large enterprises negotiate volume discounts.
  Reserved instance planning requires manual forecasting; RI portfolios become
  stale within 6 months due to changing workloads.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest CloudWatch/Stackdriver metrics → Demand forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet) →
    Instance type optimization (price-performance ratio) → RI purchase orchestration →
    Continuous rebalancing agents
  technical_stack:
    - APIs: AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Recommender, Azure Reservations
    - ML: Time series forecasting (Prophet), optimization algorithms
    - Agents: Purchase scheduling, commitment notification, drift detection
  revenue_model: "Freemium ($0-2K/month) + 15% of annual savings (SaaS model)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2800000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.0
  target_users_estimate: 95
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2456
feasibility_score: 9.3
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "7 weeks (Cloud API integration → forecasting → optimization engine → purchase automation)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Cloud API rate limits; mitigation = batching + caching.
  Business: Customer cloud vendor lock-in concerns; mitigation = multi-cloud focus.
  Legal: Automated purchasing requires approval workflows; mitigation = dry-run mode.
