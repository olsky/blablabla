title: Predictive Demand Forecasting and Load Balancing System
description: An autonomous AI-driven platform that analyzes real-time data from EV charging stations, weather patterns, traffic flows, and user behavior to predict charging demand spikes. It dynamically redistributes load across infrastructure to prevent grid overloads, optimizing energy usage and enabling premium pricing for peak-time access. Revenue streams include subscription fees from charging operators and dynamic surcharge collections.
