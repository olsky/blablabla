title: "Hospital Patient No-Show Predictor & Intervention Engine"
description: |
  ML system that predicts appointment no-shows (20-30% rates in many clinics) and
  autonomously triggers interventions (SMS reminders, phone calls via Twilio, schedule
  adjustments). Integrates with Epic EHR, Cerner, and practice management systems via FHIR APIs.
  Reduces no-shows by 25-40%, recovering $500K-$5M annually per hospital.
problem_statement: |
  Healthcare no-shows waste $150B+ annually across US healthcare system.
  Appointments with empty slots reduce provider efficiency and patient access.
  Hospitals currently rely on basic SMS reminders; no predictive targeting.
  Minority/low-income patients have 2-3x higher no-show rates; untapped intervention opportunity.
solution:
  approach: |
    FHIR data ingest (appointment history, demographics, transport proxies) →
    Features (prior no-shows, distance, socioeconomic indicators) → No-show
    prediction model → Causal inference to identify effective interventions per
    patient segment → Autonomous reminder/transportation assistance agents
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Epic/Cerner FHIR APIs, practice management systems
    - Features: Historical no-show patterns, social determinants (SDOH)
    - Interventions: Twilio SMS/calls, Uber/Lyft credits, schedule optimization
    - ML: Gradient boosting (prediction), causal forest (intervention targeting)
  revenue_model: "% of recovered appointments ($0.25-1.00 per prevented no-show) + fixed SaaS ($1K-5K)"

risk_analysis: |
  Legal: HIPAA compliance required; mitigation = BAA agreements + data minimization.
  Ethical: Targeting low-income patients; mitigation = transparent, equitable algorithms.
  Business: Hospital integration complexity; mitigation = pre-built Epic/Cerner connectors.
