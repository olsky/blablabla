title: "Factory Floor Yield Optimization Engine"
description: |
  ML system for semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and advanced manufacturing that predicts
  yield loss mechanisms in real-time and recommends process interventions. Uses process
  parameters, equipment telemetry, wafer/batch metadata. Increases yield by 3-8% (worth
  $50M-$200M+ annually for semiconductor fabs).
problem_statement: |
  Semiconductor manufacturing yield losses cost $200B+ globally annually (3-8% yield
  variance across fabs). Each percent yield improvement is worth $50-200M for large
  fab. Most optimization is offline (statistical process control); real-time prediction
  doesn't exist at scale.
solution:
  approach: |
    Process data ingest (equipment parameters: temperature, pressure, gas flows) +
    Metrology data (wafer metrics) + Yield outcomes → Feature engineering (process
    signatures) → Yield prediction model → Anomaly detection (process drift) →
    Intervention recommendations (adjust parameters, stop batch, maintenance alert)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), equipment sensors (Cali), metrology tools
    - ML: Gradient boosting for yield prediction, process drift detection
    - Integration: FDC (Fault Detection & Classification) systems, equipment controllers
  revenue_model: "SaaS per fabrication line ($20K-50K/month) + % of recovered yield (2-5%)"
business_case:

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "10 weeks (MES/equipment sensor integration → feature engineering → yield prediction → closed-loop automation)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Manufacturing process parameterization is domain-specific; mitigation = hire fab physicist.
  Business: Only applies to high-yield manufacturing; mitigation = focus on semicon/pharma initially.
  Regulatory: Pharma manufacturing regulated (GMP); mitigation = compliance by design.
