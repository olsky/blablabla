title: Autonomous Accounts Receivable & Debt Collection Orchestrator
description: |
  **Idea:** B2B companies have billions tied up in unpaid invoices because following up is awkward, manual, and time-consuming. This system connects to ERP/Accounting platforms (NetSuite, QuickBooks) to monitor invoice aging. Instead of a human sending emails, the autonomous orchestrator uses predictive scoring to determine the optimal communication channel and tone. It auto-generates personalized emails referencing specific line items, negotiates payment plans via conversational AI, triggers automated SMS reminders, and if 90+ days past due, automatically drafts a "Demand Letter" formatted to the debtor's local jurisdiction, complete with digital letterhead, and routes the invoice to a predefined legal partner API for formal action.

  **Why "WOW":** Cash flow is oxygen for B2B. A system that seamlessly pulls forward receivables reduces Day Sales Outstanding (DSO) by 30-40% without hiring collections agents. The CFO sees immediate treasury impact.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (ERP/Accounting APIs, communication channels [Twilio/SendGrid], localized legal demand templates, LLM negotiation training).
  - Cash Out: Tiered SaaS ($500-$5,000/mo) based on volume of invoices managed, plus a transaction fee for legal escalation.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Active B2B Customers: 1,500
  - Average Monthly Fee (Blended): $1,200
  - Estimated Earnings: $21,600,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10 (Accounting APIs are rich. The main complexity is tuning the LLM to negotiate payment plans without over-promising or violating fair debt collection practices, though B2B is less regulated than B2C.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Maintaining a balance in tone; overly aggressive AI could damage the client's vendor relationships.
  - Medium: Legal framework variations for drafting Demand Letters.
  - Low: Technical execution of API data ingestion.
