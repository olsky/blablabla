title: Autonomous Dynamic Pricing Engine for Cloud Resources
description: |
  **Idea:** A self‑optimizing service that continuously monitors cloud provider spot‑price fluctuations, workload demand, and SLA requirements. Using reinforcement learning agents, it automatically migrates workloads across providers and adjusts reserved instance purchases to maximize cost savings. All decisions, negotiations, and billing are performed by autonomous agents via provider APIs.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months to develop the RL engine, integrate provider APIs, and set up secure credential management.
  - Cash Out: Subscription tier based on %‑of‑savings achieved. Break‑even expected after 2 months of operation for early adopters.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Paying Enterprises: 80
  - Average Savings per Customer: $12,500
  - Estimated Earnings: $1,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Requires multi‑cloud API access and robust security, but feasible with existing SDKs.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium Risk: Cloud provider API changes could disrupt automation.
  - Low Risk: Technical complexity mitigated by using open‑source RL libraries.
