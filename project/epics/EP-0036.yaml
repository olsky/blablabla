title: Autonomous "Negative-Grip" Cybersecurity Honeypot Network
description: |
  **Idea:** An active-defense cybersecurity platform that doesn't just block hackers but traps them in an autonomous, high-interaction honeypot network. The "Negative-Grip" agent dynamically clones the company's internal services (synthetic twins) and feeds hackers poisoned, subtly-mutated synthetic data. This data is watermarked such that its presence in any subsequent leak/transaction exposes the attacker's supply-chain.
  
  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (Developing the high-interaction deception engine + synthetic data poisoning agents).
  - Cash Out: Subscription-based "Threat Intelligence as an Active Weapon" + Bounty fees for recovered/identified attacker IPs.
  
  **Projections:**
  - First-Year Earnings: $720,000 (Targeted at high-value financial/tech targets).
  - First-Year Users: 60 Enterprise Security Departments.
  
  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Deception technology is a mature niche; autonomous "cloning" of services is the innovation).
  
  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Escalation risk (attackers might retaliate harder if they feel "tricked").
  - Low: Technical stability of the honeypot containers.
