title: "Autonomous Demand-Driven Charging Orchestrator"
description: "A software platform that autonomously manages EV charging infrastructure by analyzing real-time demand patterns, grid capacity, and user preferences to dynamically allocate charging slots and optimize energy distribution. Leverages machine learning on historical and live data to predict peak times, prevent overloads, and maximize utilization, generating revenue through premium access fees and grid stabilization incentives."
