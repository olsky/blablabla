title: "Poultry Environmental Control & Energy Cost Optimizer"
description: |
  Autonomous climate control agent optimizing HVAC, lighting, and ventilation
  settings based on real-time bird behavior, outdoor weather, and energy costs.
  Agents predict thermal comfort zones and recommend setpoint adjustments to balance
  energy consumption with production performance.
problem_statement: |
  Environmental control (heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting) represents 8-15%
  of production costs and directly impacts bird performance. Dynamic optimization
  could save $200-500 per flock while improving growth and feed conversion. Current
  systems use fixed setpoints; no real-time agent adapts to ambient conditions,
  bird growth stage, and energy price volatility.
solution:
  approach: |
    Ingest climate sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2, light level), outdoor
    weather forecasts, bird life stage (age, weight), and real-time energy pricing.
    Build ML models predicting bird thermal comfort and optimal environmental ranges.
    Agents recommend HVAC adjustments (ventilation rate, heater/cooler setpoints)
    and lighting schedules to minimize energy while maintaining performance.
  technical_stack: |
    Barn controller APIs (environmental sensors), weather forecast APIs (NOAA,
    local), real-time energy price feeds (ISO markets or utility APIs), climate
    modeling (thermal dynamics of barns), optimization algorithms.
  revenue_model: |
    SaaS per barn ($1.5K-3K/month) + performance share (3-5% of energy cost reduction).
business_case:

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "MVP: 7 weeks. Full: 10 weeks."
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Barn controller APIs vary; mitigation: modular integrations with top
  controller vendors. Business: Regulatory compliance for environmental parameters;
  mitigation: ensure all recommendations stay within welfare/health guidelines.
