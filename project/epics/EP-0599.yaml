title: Algorithmic Yield Optimization for Commercial Vertical Farming
description: |
  **Idea:** Indoor vertical farms (Bowery, Plenty) burn massive capital tweaking lights and nutrients manually. This system acts as the absolute brain of the facility. It ingests thousands of hyper-spectral camera images of the plant leaves, soil chemistry IoT sensors, and local spot-energy prices. It runs deep reinforcement learning to autonomously adjust the exact LED light spectrum (e.g. adding 2% more blue light) and nutrient drip every 5 minutes to maximize biomass yield mathematically while minimizing energy draw.

  **Why "WOW":** Pure robotic horticulture. Running biology like an optimized, high-frequency software loop.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Integrating with legacy indoor farming SCADA systems and training the biological crop models).
  - Cash Out: SaaS fee + 10% royalty on the net-new crop yield generated over the baseline.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Vertical Farms Under Management: 500 (Massive facilities)
  - Estimated Revenue: $100,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Hardware failures (The LED panels failing to respond quickly enough to the algorithms commands).
  - Medium: The algorithmic learning phase accidentally killing a $5M crop while exploring parameters.
  - Low: Farming economics (Indoor farms are struggling to hit profitability; they need this optimization to survive).
