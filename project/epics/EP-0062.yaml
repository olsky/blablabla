title: Autonomous Mobile Ad-Fraud Refund Recovery Network
description: |
  **Idea:** App publishers and gaming studios absorb invalid traffic spend from sophisticated click-injection, SDK spoofing, and install-fraud patterns that are discovered too late. This network ingests MMP attribution logs, SKAdNetwork postbacks, in-app event quality signals, ad-network invoices, and fraud graph telemetry to autonomously quantify refundable spend.

  Agents compile fraud-proof evidence packets, submit refund/rebate claims to ad partners, enforce holdback policies, and dynamically reallocate budgets to cleaner supply paths.

  **Why "WOW":** Growth teams recover budget while simultaneously improving ROAS — a rare immediate double win.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months (attribution connectors, fraud graph, claim workflow automation).
  - Cash Out: recovery share + network optimization SaaS tier.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Publisher/Studio Customers: 4,800
  - Average Fraud Spend Recovered per Customer: $48,000
  - Recovery Share Revenue (18%): $41,472,000
  - SaaS Revenue: $7,680,000
  - Total Estimated Earnings: $49,152,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Ad-network evidence standards vary; mitigated by network-specific claim templates and confidence scoring.
  - Medium: Attribution blind spots; mitigated through multi-signal anomaly fusion and delayed-conversion correction windows.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Targets only evidence-backed invalid traffic recovery and enforces transparent, contract-aligned claim behavior.
