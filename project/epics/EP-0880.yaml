title: AI-Directed Global Sanctions-Evasion Detection Oracle
description: |
  **Idea:** Sanctioned entities use 'Dark Fleets' and shell-companies to move billions. This AI agent monitors global shipping transponders, satellite sonar-drifts (to find ships with transponders off), and the 'Social Graph' of corporate ownership across 200 jurisdictions. It autonomously flags a transaction as 'Evasion-Risk' and prevents the settlement via institutional banking API.

  **Why "WOW":** It serves as the 'Global Eye' for compliance. It identifies the invisible, dark patterns of global evasion that human auditors miss 99% of the time.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3.5 months (Building the cross-data satellite/transponder GNN and the global entity-graph analyzer).
  - Cash Out: Annual license: $1M+ per Tier-1 Global Bank.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Tier-1 Banks Onboarded: 150
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Diplomatic/Legal pressure—sanctioned nations launch cyber-attacks against the platform to disable the 'Global Eye'.
  - Medium: False Positives causing legitimate humanitarian trade to be blocked incorrectly.
  - Low: Mandatory Compliance (Banks MUST stop sanctions evasion or face billion-dollar fines).
