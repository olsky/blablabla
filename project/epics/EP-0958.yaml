title: "Commercial Insurance Claims Optimization Engine"
description: |
  ML system for insurance companies and adjusters that predicts claims severity/complexity
  early, routes to appropriate adjusters, and identifies fraud indicators. Reduces claims
  cycle time 30-40% and fraud by 20-30%. Integrates with claims management systems.
problem_statement: |
  Commercial insurance claims processing costs insurers $40B+ annually. Average claims
  cycle is 45-120 days; customer satisfaction is low (30% churn due to delays). Fraud
  costs insurers $30B+ (5-10% of claims are fraudulent). Routing to wrong adjuster
  delays resolution.
solution:
  approach: |
    Claims data ingest (loss description, claimant info, coverage, prior claims) →
    Severity/complexity scoring → Fraud risk assessment (inconsistencies, pattern matching,
    soft indicators) → Optimal adjuster matching (expertise, capacity, prior success rate) →
    Outcome tracking (cycle time, resolution rate)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Claims systems APIs, external data sources (court records, social media, background checks with consent), historical claim outcomes
    - ML: Claims triage (risk scoring), fraud detection, adjuster matching
    - Agents: Auto-routing, priority flagging
  revenue_model: "SaaS per insurer ($10K-50K/month) + % of avoided fraud losses (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2400000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.1
  target_users_estimate: 40
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 5000
status: draft
feasibility_score: 8.5
implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Claims system integration → severity/fraud models → adjuster optimization)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Privacy/data source concerns; mitigation = transparent data usage + opt-in.
  Regulatory: Insurance regulations on claims handling; mitigation = compliance review.
  Business: Requires insurer buy-in; mitigation = target top 20 insurers first.
