title: "Construction Project Cost Overrun Prediction & Control"
description: |
  ML system for general contractors/constructors that predicts cost overruns early
  (weeks 2-4 of project) based on material prices, labor productivity, RFI trends,
  and change order patterns. Recommends interventions to prevent budget slippage.
  Integrates with construction management software (Procore, Bridgit, Touchplan).
problem_statement: |
  $2T+ annual construction spending; 75-90% of projects experience cost overruns
  (average 4-8% over budget). Small contractors lack cost prediction tools; overruns
  destroy margins. Material price volatility (post-COVID) increased unpredictability.
solution:
  approach: |
    Project data ingest (budget, actuals, labor logs, material orders, RFIs, change orders) →
    Cost driver analysis (labor productivity variance, material cost inflation, scope creep
    signals) → Early warning model → Intervention recommendations (value engineering,
    schedule optimization, vendor negotiation)
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Procore/Bridgit APIs, labor tracking, material pricing feeds
    - ML: Time series forecasting, cost overrun prediction
    - Agents: Budget monitoring, change order analysis, risk alerting
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($1K-5K/month) + % of prevented overruns (5-10%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1300000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.4
  target_users_estimate: 80
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1354
feasibility_score: 8.4
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Construction API integration → cost model → early warning system)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Construction software fragmentation; mitigation = target top 5 platforms.
  Business: Adoption requires discipline; mitigation = value-add reporting + benchmarking.
  Market: Tight margins; mitigation = quick payback period (month 1-2).
