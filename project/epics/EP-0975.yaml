title: "Product Feature Adoption & Engagement Prediction"
description: |
  ML system that predicts which users will adopt new product features and when. Recommends
  optimal timing/messaging for feature rollout to maximize adoption without overwhelming
  users. Increases feature adoption by 30-50%.
problem_statement: |
  Product teams invest $10M+ in new features; 40% of users never adopt them. Feature
  rolling is one-size-fits-all (email + in-app banner). Slack, Figma, Notion excel at
  adoption; most struggle.
solution:
  approach: |
    User engagement + product telemetry → Adoption readiness scoring → User segmentation →
    Personalized feature rollout timing → Outcome tracking
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Product analytics APIs (Amplitude, Mixpanel), user databases
    - ML: Adoption prediction, optimal rollout timing
    - Agents: Feature rollout orchestration, messaging personalization
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-8K/month per product company)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.4
  target_users_estimate: 85
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1569
feasibility_score: 8.6
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Analytics API → adoption model → rollout orchestration)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Product analytics API variety; mitigation = top 3 platforms (Amplitude/Mixpanel).
  Business: Product teams have strong opinions; mitigation = recommendation vs. mandate.
  Data: User event data quality varies; mitigation = data validation + cleansing.
