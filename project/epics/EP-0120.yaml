title: "Autonomous Global Unclaimed-Asset Reunification Engine"
description: |
  **Idea:** Governments, banks, insurers, and pension funds worldwide hold over **$80 billion** in unclaimed property — dormant bank accounts, forgotten insurance payouts, uncashed dividend checks, abandoned safe-deposit contents, uncollected tax refunds, and orphaned pension entitlements. Rightful owners (or their heirs) don't know the money exists. Custodians are legally obligated to perform due diligence but lack the tooling. Today, reunification is done by manual lookup on individual state websites — there is no unified, intelligent, cross-border discovery layer.

  This engine simultaneously ingests every publicly accessible unclaimed-property registry (50 US states + DC + 30 EU member-state programs + UK, Canada, Australia, Japan), insurer unclaimed-benefits feeds (NAIC), pension tracing services, shareholder registries, and probate records. Autonomous agents match assets to persons using probabilistic identity resolution across name variants, address histories, SSN fragments, and genealogical records. For verified matches, agents auto-generate jurisdiction-specific claim forms, attach supporting evidence (ID verification via eIDAS/government APIs), file electronically where supported, and track disbursement.

  **Consumer viral loop:** Free self-serve portal — "Find your unclaimed money in 30 seconds." Users enter name + DOB → system returns matched assets across all jurisdictions instantly → one-click claim filing → money arrives. Every person who recovers $800 tells 10 friends. Organic growth engine.

  **B2B loop:** Banks, insurers, and state treasurers subscribe to a compliance module that proactively identifies owners before assets escheat, avoiding regulatory penalties and reputational risk.

  **Why "WOW":** There is literally no product on Earth that lets a person search all global unclaimed-property databases in one query and file claims autonomously. The moment someone recovers forgotten money, the word-of-mouth is explosive. The phrase "free money" is the most powerful growth hack in existence.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 months (registry scrapers/APIs, identity resolution graph, claim-form automation, compliance module).
  - Cash Out: Consumer — 10-15% of recovered amount. B2B — $50K-$500K/yr compliance SaaS per institution.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Consumer Claims Filed: 8,000,000
  - Average Recovery per Claim: $1,400
  - Gross Recovered: $11,200,000,000
  - Consumer Fee Revenue (12%): $1,344,000,000
  - Conservative Realization (10% of filings succeed in Y1): $134,400,000
  - B2B Compliance Revenue: $28,000,000
  - **Total Estimated Earnings: $162,400,000**

  **Feasibility Score:** 9.2/10 — All registries are public. Identity resolution is a solved problem (probabilistic matching). Claim filing is form submission. No novel research required; this is an execution play on publicly available data that nobody has unified.

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Regulatory variance in claim-filing procedures; mitigated by jurisdiction-specific filing adapters and continuous legal monitoring agents.
  - Medium: Identity verification for large claims; mitigated by tiered verification (low-value = self-serve, high-value = government eID gateway).
  - Low: Data access — registries are legally mandated to be public.

  **Legal & Ethical:** Recovery of rightful property is explicitly encouraged by law in all target jurisdictions. Fee structures comply with state-level claim-agent licensing requirements.
