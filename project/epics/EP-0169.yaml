title: Autonomous Global Digital Advertising Attribution & ROI Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Digital advertisers spend $600B annually across platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok) but lack transparent, cross‑platform attribution. This autonomous service aggregates raw impression, click, and conversion data from all major ad networks via unified APIs, enriches it with third‑party CRM and sales data, and applies AI‑driven multi‑touch attribution models to assign precise ROI to each ad placement. Results are delivered in real‑time via a tokenized API, and smart contracts automatically settle performance‑based payments to publishers, eliminating fraud and opaque fee structures.

  **Why "WOW":** Provides advertisers with a single, auditable ROI view across the entire digital ecosystem, reducing wasted spend by up to 30% and unlocking $180B of reclaimed budget. Publishers receive guaranteed, performance‑based payouts, fostering a healthier ad market.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~15 months (building unified data pipelines, AI attribution models, compliance with privacy regulations, smart‑contract settlement layer).
  - Cash Out: 3% of the total ad spend optimized through the platform.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Total Ad Spend Processed: $200,000,000,000
  - Estimated Savings for Advertisers (15%): $30,000,000,000
  - Platform Revenue (3% of processed spend): $6,000,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Data APIs exist; biggest challenge is negotiating data sharing agreements with major platforms and ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Legal and regulatory hurdles around cross‑platform data sharing.
  - Medium: Resistance from incumbent ad‑tech firms protecting their black‑box models.
  - Low: Technical scalability – cloud‑native data processing pipelines can handle petabyte‑scale workloads.
