title: Autonomous Open-Source Project Commercial Viability Underwriter
description: |
  **Idea:** A service that acts as an autonomous investment analyst specifically for open-source software ecosystems. It monitors all new GitHub repositories above a certain popularity threshold. Agents score each project across a proprietary multi-dimensional model: number of Fortune-500 companies depending on this package (derived from public package-lock.json files), committer bus-factor, licensing compatibility with commercial use, and how many open issues request features only a commercial offering could sustain. Projects hitting a threshold receive an auto-generated "Commercial Readiness Score" report. These reports are sold as a data subscription to venture capital funds that invest in open-source-derived startups.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~6 weeks. GitHub data access via BigQuery public datasets. The scoring model construction is the intellectual challenge.
  - Cash Out: VC and PE fund data subscriptions.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Fund Subscribers: 20
  - Estimated Earnings: $200,000 ($833/mo/fund)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (All underlying data is public; the scoring model itself is the durable competitive moat.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Low Risk: Publishing analytical scores on public repositories carries no legal exposure.
  - Reputational Risk: A low score on an OSS project that then becomes a unicorn startup destroys credibility. Scoring methodology must be transparently documented.
