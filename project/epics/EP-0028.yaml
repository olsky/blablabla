title: Autonomous Real-Time ESG Scoring Service
description: |
  **Idea:** A platform that continuously ingests corporate disclosures, news, social media, and regulatory filings to compute real‑time Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores for publicly traded companies. Autonomous agents perform data extraction, sentiment analysis, and scoring model updates, delivering scores via API to asset managers and ESG‑focused investors.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months to build data pipelines, ESG scoring models, and API infrastructure.
  - Cash Out: Tiered SaaS pricing per company score request. Break‑even expected by month 4.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Paying Asset Managers: 70
  - Average Requests per Manager per Month: 1,200
  - Estimated Earnings: $1,008,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10 (Requires robust data licensing and NLP pipelines, but feasible with existing services.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium Risk: Data licensing compliance and model bias; mitigated with transparent methodology and legal review.
  - Low Risk: Technical complexity manageable with open‑source frameworks.
