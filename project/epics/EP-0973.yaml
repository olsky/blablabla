title: "Subscription Metrics & MRR Intelligence Platform"
description: |
  ML system that aggregates subscription billing data across all payment platforms
  and provides real-time MRR/ARR forecasting, cohort retention curves, and expansion
  revenue tracking. Predicts revenue next 12 months with 85%+ accuracy.
problem_statement: |
  SaaS founders lack unified visibility into MRR/ARR across Stripe, Chargebee, Zuora.
  Revenue forecasting for fundraising is manual (spreadsheets). Cohort retention analysis
  requires SQL. Most SaaS compounds can't track true expansion revenue.
solution:
  approach: |
    Billing system ingest (Stripe, Chargebee APIs) → MRR/ARR calculation → Cohort
    retention curves → Expansion revenue tracking → Churn prediction → Revenue forecast
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Stripe, Chargebee, Zuora APIs
    - ML: Time series forecasting (Prophet), cohort retention analysis
    - Dashboard: MRR trends, cohort funnels, forecast models
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($500-2K/month) per company + freemium upsell"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 1200000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.8
  target_users_estimate: 400
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 250
feasibility_score: 9.1
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "7 weeks (Billing API integration → MRR calculation → forecast models)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Billing API variety; mitigation = focus on top 50% (Stripe, Chargebee).
  Market: Many BI tools already do this; mitigation = simplicity + founder focus.
  Data: Sensitive billing data; mitigation = secure SOC2 architecture.
