title: "Legal Document Contract Intelligence & Risk Extraction"
description: |
  ML system for corporate legal teams that auto-extracts key contract terms (payment terms,
  liability caps, indemnification, termination clauses) from procurement/vendor agreements.
  Flags unusual/risky terms; surfaces deviation from approved templates. Integrates with
  document management systems (SharePoint, Box, Sharepoint) via APIs.
problem_statement: |
  Fortune 500s sign thousands of contracts annually; most lack systematic review of
  deviation from standard terms. Legal review is bottleneck (costs $5K per contract).
  Unreviewed contracts expose companies to litigation, payment disputes, and operational risk.
  $100B+ in unquantified contract risk exists in enterprises.
solution:
  approach: |
    Contract document ingest (auto-OCR PDFs) → Extract key terms using NLP (parties,
    dates, payment terms, liability) → Benchmark against standard templates → Flag
    anomalies/risks → Generate risk reports → Alert legal teams
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Document management APIs (SharePoint, Box), PDF processing
    - ML: NLP for clause extraction, anomaly detection vs. templates
    - Agents: Document monitoring, risk flagging
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($5K-20K/month) + value share on avoided litigation risk"

implementation_timeline: "9 weeks (Document API integration → NLP term extraction → template matching → risk alerts)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: Legal language variation high; mitigation = train on domain-specific contracts.
  Legal: Contract interpretation is nuanced; mitigation = human review required for enforcement.
  Business: Legal teams cautious with automation; mitigation = vendor relationships + trust-building.
