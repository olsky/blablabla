title: '"Click-to-Compliance": Autonomous GDPR/CCPA Privacy Orchestration Proxy'
description: |
  **Idea:** Every website that processes user data is legally required to manage consent, honor deletion requests, and maintain processing records. Most fail — not from bad intent, but because the engineering effort is prohibitive. This service acts as a one-line JavaScript snippet + CDN-level reverse proxy. Autonomous agents continuously scan the website's data flows, inventory all third-party trackers, auto-generate a legally sound consent UI, intercept and route consent signals to all downstream vendors via IAB TCF 2.2 protocol, and auto-process Subject Access Requests (SARs) from inboxes. Compliance attorneys receive a monthly auto-generated audit report.

  **Why "WOW":** Any website manager can achieve full GDPR/CCPA compliance by pasting one line of JavaScript. GDPR fines exceeded €4.2B in 2023. Every website on Earth is a potential customer.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~5 months (Consent UI engine, TCF 2.2 integration, SAR processing bots, audit report generation).
  - Cash Out: $99-$999/month SaaS based on monthly active users.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Paying Websites (out of 200M with GDPR exposure): 85,000
  - Average Plan: $250/month
  - Estimated Earnings: $25,500,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10 (TCF 2.2 is a published open standard; proxy technology is commodity. This is an execution game, not a research game.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Medium: Regulatory shifts could require rapid feature changes.
  - Medium: Competition from OneTrust ($5B valuation) — but OneTrust costs $50k+/year; this democratizes the market below that.
  - Low: Technical complexity.
