title: "Commercial Lending Underwriting Automation"
description: |
  AI system for commercial lenders and banks that autonomously underwriters small-to-mid
  market business loans by analyzing financials, credit fundamentals, industry risk,
  and cash flow projections. Auto-approves low-risk loans in <24 hours; accelerates
  approval 10x vs. manual process.
problem_statement: |
  $1.5T+ in small business lending annually; average approval takes 30-60 days. Manual
  underwriting costs $2K-5K per loan. Alternative lenders use automated underwriting,
  disrupting traditional banks. Community banks lack scale for automation; lose SME deals
  to faster fintech competitors.
solution:
  approach: |
    Financial doc ingest (tax returns, P&Ls, balance sheets via OCR) → Data extraction →
    Baseline financials normalization → Credit scoring + industry risk adjustment →
    Cash flow analysis + debt service coverage ratio → Rule-based approval engine with
    condition generation
  technical_stack:
    - Data: PDF/image processing (OCR), CRE/Dun & Bradstreet APIs for industry data
    - ML: Credit scoring models, cash flow forecasting
    - Workflows: Approval routing, document collection, loan documentation generation
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($1K-3K per lender/month) + origination fees ($50-200 per approved loan)"

risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Banking regulation (Fair Lending, Truth in Lending); mitigation = compliance audits + human override.
  Credit: Model risk of underwriting; mitigation = conservative defaults, losses tracked for continuous improvement.
  Adoption: Requires bank buy-in on automation; mitigation = target fintech/online lenders first.
