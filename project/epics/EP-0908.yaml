title: Autonomous Government RFP Proposal Automation Factory
description: |
  Autonomously generates 50-page government proposal responses matching RFP requirements and evaluation criteria. The system ingests SAM.gov RFP feed in real-time, extracts requirements/evaluation criteria/FAR clauses, retrieves customer's past performance data from FPDS (Federal Procurement Data System), generates technical approach sections, cost estimates, compliance sections, and produces submission-ready PDFs. Human review = 2 hours instead of 100+ hours manual writing.

  **Why "WOW":** Addresses $150B SMB government procurement gap. Federal spending rising (CHIPS Act, IRA, Defense). Zero endocompetitors in automated RFP space. SMBs desperate for automation; willingly pay $5k per proposal.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (RFP parser, FAR clause library, LLM training, FPDS integration)
  - Cash Out: $5k flat fee per RFP proposal generated

  **First Year Projections:**
  - SMB customers: 5 pilots = $600k per SMB annually (3-4 proposals/month)
  - Total portfolio: $25-50M (scaling to 500 SMBs × $50k/year by Year 2)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.6/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: SMB sales friction (fragmented market; long sales cycles)
  - Medium: Government RFP format changes quarterly; requires template adaptation
  - Low: Regulatory risk (FAR clauses are standardized; compliance is deterministic)
