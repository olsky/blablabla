title: Autonomous Medical Coding Denial Appeal Agent
description: |
  Autonomously generates and submits medical coding appeals for denied healthcare claims. The system ingests denied claims from hospital payer feeds, retrieves supporting clinical documentation from EHR APIs (Epic, Cerner), cross-references denial reasons against CMS LCD/NCD policies, and generates legally-compliant appeal letters with evidence citations. Appeals are submitted via secure payer portals or EDI channels.

  **Why "WOW":** Addresses $15B annual gap where valid claims are incorrectly denied. Hospital CFOs recover margin immediately (Day 1 of production). No endocompetitor exists in provider-side automated appeals (health plans' systems are internal only).

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (EHR integration, policy database normalization, LLM training on appeal precedents)
  - Cash Out: 25-35% contingency fee on appeal recovery

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Hospital systems: 1-2 pilots = $2.8M-$5.6M annual revenue per hospital
  - Total portfolio: $140-180M (scaling to 10-15 hospitals by Year 2)

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: 5-10% of cases require manual medical coder escalation for ambiguous medical necessity
  - Medium: HIPAA compliance requirements; PHI data handling must meet BAA standards
  - Low: Market demand (hospitals are desperate for margin recovery post-pandemic)
