title: Algorithmic Healthcare Claims Denial Appeal Submitter
description: |
  **Idea:** Health insurance companies automatically deny 15%+ of valid medical claims because doctors lack the time to fight back. This system connects to the hospital's EHR and billing APIs. When an insurer denies a $50,000 surgery claim, the agent instantly cross-references the insurer's exact medical policy PDFs against the patient's doctors notes. It algorithmically generates a 30-page, legally unassailable medical necessity appeal and fires it back via EDI.

  **Why "WOW":** Weapons-grade bureaucratic combat. It forces insurers to pay via sheer algorithmic stamina, recovering billions for hospitals.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~2.5 months (LLM RAG over messy insurer policy docs, secure EHR API routing).
  - Cash Out: 10% contingency on all previously denied funds successfully recovered.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Denied Claims Overturned: $1,500,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Insurers changing appeals portals to block automated submissions.
  - Medium: Maintaining strict HIPAA compliance while using LLMs.
  - Low: Hospital willingness to pay (Pure recovered revenue).
