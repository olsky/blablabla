title: Autonomous "Song-Sample" Royalty Sniper
description: |
  **Idea:** Billions in music royalties are lost because streamers and DJ-sets use 3-5 second samples without a license. This AI agent monitors every sub-second of global broadcast and streaming data using high-frequency audio-fingerprinting. It identifies unlicensed samples and autonomously files a 'Micro-Claim' via the streaming platform's API (Spotify/YouTube/Twitch) for an instant revenue split.

  **Why "WOW":** It enables 'Micro-Monetization' for artists. It identifies the 'Invisible Samples' that traditional Shazam-like services miss due to noise or duration.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the sub-second audio-fingerprinting ML and the global streaming firehose ingest).
  - Cash Out: $0.05 per unlicensed play identified + 20% of the ongoing royalty split.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Global Streams Monitored daily: 1,000,000,000
  - Unidentified Samples Found (0.1%): 1,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $120,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Streaming platforms (Spotify) changing their 'Third-Party Claims' API to limit algorithmic filings.
  - Medium: 'Transformative Use' legal gray-areas where a sample is altered beyond recognition.
  - Low: High Growth (Music sampling is exploding in the TikTok/Reels era).
