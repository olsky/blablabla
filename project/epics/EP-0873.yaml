title: Algorithmic Secondary Market for Future SaaS Contracts (Tokenized)
description: |
  **Idea:** SaaS companies have 'Annual Contracts' where the customer has legally committed to pay $1M next year. This platform tokenizes that future legal-commitment. The AI agent underwriters the 'Customer Default Risk' and sells the $1M 'Future Payment Token' to institutional buyers for $950k upfront, providing instant capex for the SaaS vendor.

  **Why "WOW":** It turns static enterprise legal contracts into a high-frequency liquid commodity. It creates the 'Trade Finance' for the software industry.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (NLP for enterprise contract risk-parsing and the contract-tokenization ledger).
  - Cash Out: 3% origination fee on every contract tokenized.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Enterprise Contracts Tokenized: $5,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $150,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8.5/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: The software customer going bankrupt, making the 'Future Payment' token worth zero.
  - Medium: Complexity in assigning 'Service-Level-Agreements' (SLAs) to a third-party debt holder.
  - Low: Founder Demand (They need money to build AI-features without giving up equity).
