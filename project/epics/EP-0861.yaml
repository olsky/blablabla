title: Generative 'Subrogation-as-an-API' Recovery Agent
description: |
  **Idea:** Insurance companies have $200B in 'Subrogation' (claims they paid, but someone else was at fault). 40% is never recovered because it's too expensive to hire lawyers for $5,000 cases. This AI agent ingests the accident report, identifies the third-party insurer at-fault, and autonomously generates and submits the subrogation claim via API, pursuing it through the automated litigation system.

  **Why "WOW":** It is the 'Clawback Master' for the insurance world. It recovers billions in lost capital for carriers with zero human lawyers.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Building the accident-logic NLP and the automated subrogation-API submission rails).
  - Cash Out: 20% cut of all successfully 'clawed back' subrogation funds.

  **First Year Projections (Solo Founder Scale):**
  - Subrogation Funds Recovered: $1,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: Automated subrogation claims being easily blocked by similar AI-driven 'rejection bots' at the other insurance company.
  - Medium: Legal jurisdiction variability in how subrogation is handled for micro-claims.
  - Low: Carrier Demand (They are desperate to improve their 'Combined Ratio').
