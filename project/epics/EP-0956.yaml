title: "Vehicle Fleet Maintenance & Telematics Optimization"
description: |
  ML system for fleet operators (logistics, delivery, ride-share) that optimizes vehicle
  maintenance schedules using telematics data (mileage, harsh braking, idle time, fuel
  consumption). Predicts brake/tire/engine failures before they occur. Reduces maintenance
  costs 25-35% and unplanned downtime 40-50%.
problem_statement: |
  Fleets waste $50B+ annually on reactive maintenance. Average fleet unplanned downtime
  costs $500-1000/day per vehicle. Most fleets use mileage-based maintenance (inefficient).
  Tire/brake failures cause accidents (liability 100K-$1M+).
solution:
  approach: |
    Telematics ingest (vehicle sensors via OBD-II, GPS, fuel consumption, diagnostics) →
    Component health scoring (wear patterns) → Failure prediction (brake fade, tire degradation,
    engine stress) → Maintenance scheduling optimization → Cost-benefit analysis per vehicle
  technical_stack:
    - Data: OBD-II devices (Samsara, Geotab), GPS/telematics, maintenance databases
    - ML: Failure prediction (gradient boosting), maintenance optimization
    - Agents: Maintenance scheduling, parts ordering, technician allocation
  revenue_model: "SaaS per vehicle ($2-8/month) + % of maintenance savings (10-15%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2300000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.0
  target_users_estimate: 120
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 1604
feasibility_score: 8.8
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (OBD-II integration → telematics pipeline → failure models → scheduling engine)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: OBD-II data standardization; mitigation = support major devices (Samsara, Geotab).
  Operational: Driver training needed; mitigation = focus on safety via behavior feedback.
  Safety: Missing maintenance risks accidents; mitigation = conservative thresholds + human review.
