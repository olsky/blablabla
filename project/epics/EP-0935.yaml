title: "Invoice & Expense Reconciliation Automation"
description: |
  AI agent that automatically matches invoices to POs, receipts, and payments; detects
  duplicate/overbilling; flags discrepancies for approval. Integrates with accounting
  systems (NetSuite, SAP, Xero, QuickBooks) via APIs. Reduces AP processing costs by 60-75%
  and catches fraud/errors worth $100K-$1M+ annually per customer.
problem_statement: |
  Fortune 500s process $500B+ in invoices annually; manual reconciliation costs 2-3 FTE
  at $100K+ annually per 20K invoices. Duplicate invoicing, data entry errors, and
  vendor fraud cost enterprises $50B+ (2-5% of AP spend). Mid-market has zero automation,
  high tail risk.
solution:
  approach: |
    Invoice ingest (email, API, OCR for PDFs) → Extract key fields (vendor, amount,
    date, GL code) → Match to POs/receipts/payments → Variance analysis → Fraud
    detection (duplicate, overbilling patterns) → Automated approval routing → GL posting
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Email parsing, PDF OCR, AP document extraction (ML)
    - APIs: NetSuite, SAP, Xero, QuickBooks integrations
    - ML: Entity matching (vendor deduplication), anomaly detection, fraud scoring
    - Workflow: Approval routing, variance approvers, GL integration
  revenue_model: "SaaS ($2K-8K/month) + % of recovered fraud/overages (15-20%)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2300000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.0

  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 2949

status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (Document extraction → vendor matching → ERP integration → approval workflows)"
risk_analysis: |
  Technical: ERP integrations are complex; mitigation = pre-built connectors for top 5.
  Business: AP team resistance (job displacement fears); mitigation = position as efficiency tool.
  Regulatory: GL accuracy requirements; mitigation = verbose audit trails.
