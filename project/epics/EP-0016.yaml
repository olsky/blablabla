title: Automated Institutional Options Flow Reconstruction Engine
description: |
  **Idea:** Every options trade on major US exchanges gets printed to the public CBOE/OCC tape within minutes. Large institutional actors (hedge funds, market makers) reveal their directional conviction through unusual options activity — massive out-of-the-money puts, or deeply dated LEAPS calls — before it shows up in stock price. This system autonomously ingests the full public options tape, normalizes and disambiguates the flow into structured conviction signals (bullish/bearish/hedging), and delivers real-time, machine-readable JSON signals to quantitative traders via a low-latency WebSocket API.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~8 weeks. The dataset is massive; achieving sub-60-second latency from tape print to structured signal delivery requires highly optimized stream processing.
  - Cash Out: Premium tiered API subscriptions ($500-$2,000/mo) to systematic traders.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - Systematic Trader Subscribers: 60
  - Estimated Earnings: $480,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 7/10 (The CBOE data is public; the latency engineering and signal disambiguation models are the significant challenge.)

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - Low Legal Risk: Processing and re-selling publicly available market data is standard financial information services.
  - Commercial Risk: Must not make predictive claims. Sold strictly as a data feed, not investment advice.
