title: Algorithmic Dark Pool for Enterprise Software Licenses
description: |
  **Idea:** Fortune 500s waste 30% of their B2B SaaS budget (Salesforce, Oracle) on 'shelfware'—seats no one uses. This exchange plugs into corporate Single Sign-On (Okta) APIs to precisely track active usage. It pools the unused, prepaid licenses across hundreds of non-competing enterprises. It then automatically re-routes and sub-leases those exact seats via API provisioning to startups at a 40% discount, arbitrating the spread.

  **Why "WOW":** A secondary market for B2B user licenses. Turns bloated corporate IT budgets into a liquid commodity.

  **ROI (Time In vs Cash Out):**
  - Time In: ~3 months (Deep API integrations into major SaaS provisioning engines and SSO providers).
  - Cash Out: 20% platform fee on the recovered software value.

  **First Year Projections:**
  - SaaS Value Arbitraged: $1,000,000,000
  - Estimated Revenue: $200,000,000

  **Feasibility Score:** 8/10

  **Risk Analysis:**
  - High: SaaS giants (Salesforce) viciously fighting the platform for violating 'non-transferable' Terms of Service.
  - Medium: The technical complexity of dynamically mapping diverse corporate SSO tenants.
  - Low: Startup demand (Half-price enterprise software).
