title: "Employee Churn Prediction & Retention Intervention Engine"
description: |
  ML system that predicts high-risk employee departures 30-60 days in advance by
  analyzing engagement signals (email activity, collaboration patterns, calendar,
  internal job applications, peer feedback), compensation relative to market, and
  growth velocity. Autonomously triggers retention interventions (promotion alerts,
  salary adjustments, reskilling plans).
problem_statement: |
  $1T+ annual cost of employee churn globally (70% turnover rate in tech/ops). Replacing
  a high performer costs 150-200% of salary. Most companies lack predictive insight;
  retention is reactive. High-risk segments (top talent, minorities, women) depart
  unnoticed until exit.
solution:
  approach: |
    Data ingest (HRIS, email, Slack, calendar, performance reviews) → Feature engineering
    (engagement, growth velocity, market comp, peer network position) → Churn risk model
    (gradient boosting) → Trigger intervention agents (manager alerts, comp review,
    growth opportunities matching) → Track outcomes
  technical_stack:
    - Data: Workday/SAP HRIS API, Slack API, Gmail/O365 metadata, internal job boards
    - ML: Churn prediction, causal inference for intervention targeting
    - Workflows: Manager alerts, promotion workflows, comp review integration
  revenue_model: "% of prevented departures in top performer cohort ($5K-50K per prevented loss) + platform SaaS ($3K-10K/yr)"
business_case:
  first_year_revenue_usd: 2600000
  roi_time_in_months: 1.5
  target_users_estimate: 55
  average_customer_value_usd_per_month: 3939
feasibility_score: 8.7
status: draft
implementation_timeline: "8 weeks (HRIS/collaboration API integration → feature engineering → churn model → intervention agents)"
risk_analysis: |
  Legal: Employee privacy and discrimination concerns; mitigation = algorithmic transparency + equity audits.
  Ethical: Predictive targeting raises autonomy concerns; mitigation = manager oversight + employee choice.
  Business: Requires cultural adoption; mitigation = start with executive sponsorship.
