summary: >-
  High-quality trade-finance automation EPIC with realistic 90-day MVP potential and clear enterprise value,
  especially when deployed as confidence-scored validation rather than opaque full automation.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Directly addresses costly document error and rework in SWIFT workflows."
    - "Strong software-only feasibility using OCR + validation + contradiction checks."
    - "Well-aligned guardrails already included in EPIC metadata."
  weaknesses:
    - "Extraction quality variance across poor scans and handwriting remains a bottleneck."
    - "Liability concerns may slow full-autonomy adoption in early customers."
    - "Requires transparent benchmarking to earn operations trust."
  risks:
    - "Technical: low-confidence extraction paths can propagate hidden errors."
    - "Market: conservative banks may insist on human validation gates initially."
    - "Legal: incorrect financial messaging can create high-impact compliance exposure."
  recommendations:
    - "Launch with confidence-tiered workflow and mandatory review at low certainty."
    - "Provide field-level provenance and contradiction explanations for auditability."
    - "Target high-volume document corridors first for rapid ROI proof."
