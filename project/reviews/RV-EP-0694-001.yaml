  **Pros:** Direct 'Cash Cow' for the SaaS economy. Every SMB SaaS is currently fighting churn and cloud-spend drift.
  **WOW Factor:** The 'Triggering corrective plays automatically' aspect is the killer app here. It moves beyond simple dashboards into an 'Autopilot for Margin'.
  **Feasibility:** 9.0 is accurate. Most data is accessible via Stripe/AWS/Segment APIs.
  **Recommendation:** Focus on 'Cloud Spend Drift' as the entry hook, as it has the most tangible, immediate ROI.
