summary: >-
  EP-0506 is currently structurally inconsistent and combines two different products in one file,
  making feasibility and business-case assessment unreliable until the EPIC is split and normalized.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Each embedded concept independently targets a high-value optimization domain."
    - "Both concepts are software-first and API-driven in principle."
    - "Potential for strong enterprise ROI exists after scoping cleanup."
  weaknesses:
    - "Duplicate id/title sections merge unrelated domains into one EPIC artifact."
    - "Conflicting review policies and projections prevent coherent prioritization."
    - "Current file cannot serve as a stable implementation planning source."
  risks:
    - "Execution: mixed scope increases product and go-to-market confusion."
    - "Market: buyers cannot evaluate value proposition without clear product boundary."
    - "Legal: compliance requirements differ significantly between the merged domains."
  recommendations:
    - "Split into separate EPICs with unique IDs and independently validated business cases."
    - "Retain one concept in EP-0506 and move the other to a new EPIC file."
    - "Re-run schema/integrity checks and then re-review each normalized EPIC."
