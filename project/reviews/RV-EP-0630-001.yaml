summary: >-
  Practical infrastructure optimization EPIC with strong feasibility and realistic ROI,
  though commercial velocity depends on overcoming maintenance-policy inertia.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Clear uptime and cost objective tied to battery replacement timing."
    - "Predictive planning architecture is mature and software-friendly."
    - "Good fit for phased autonomy deployment in operations teams."
  weaknesses:
    - "Sparse failure labels can limit model confidence for edge assets."
    - "Organizational reluctance may slow autonomous scheduling adoption."
    - "Warranty constraints may cap optimization latitude."
  risks:
    - "Technical: rare-event prediction errors can misallocate maintenance spend."
    - "Market: change management overhead may delay value realization."
    - "Legal: replacement timing must align with supplier warranty obligations."
  recommendations:
    - "Use hybrid rules+ML strategy with conservative fallback thresholds."
    - "Start with advisory mode and graduate to automatic scheduling by confidence band."
    - "Quantify avoided outages and spend efficiency in pilot reporting."
