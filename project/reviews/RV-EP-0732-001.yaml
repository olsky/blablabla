summary: >-
  Very strong commercial candidate: dynamic pricing for EV charging has immediate monetization,
  high data leverage, and strong feasibility if pricing governance is robust.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Direct, measurable margin uplift for operators."
    - "High automation potential with mature demand/pricing optimization methods."
    - "Distribution can piggyback existing charging and payment integrations."
  weaknesses:
    - "Risk of user backlash if pricing feels opaque or exploitative."
    - "Requires careful reinforcement-learning safeguards in volatile demand conditions."
    - "Competitive pressure from basic dynamic-pricing modules."
  risks:
    - "Technical: model instability during edge demand events can hurt trust."
    - "Market: retention depends on consistent savings/value versus fixed pricing alternatives."
    - "Legal: dynamic pricing must remain compliant with fairness and disclosure requirements."
  recommendations:
    - "Implement policy constraints and explainability layer before autonomous price actuation."
    - "Run controlled A/B pilots with transparent user communication."
    - "Expose operator override controls with audit trails for regulatory defensibility."
