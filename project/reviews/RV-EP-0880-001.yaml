  **Strategic Value:** 
  This is a high-conviction "Killer App." Sanctions compliance is currently the highest-liability cost center for global financial institutions. A localized, high-frequency oracle that identifies "Dark Fleet" movements via data-fusion (AIS + Satellite Sonar) provides a critical defense layer that legacy systems lack.

  **Feasibility Notes:** 
  - **Technical:** 8/10. The fusion of AIS telemetry with satellite sonar/optical signals is technically viable via a handful of specialized API providers (e.g., Spire, Iceye). The primary challenge is the "Social Graph" mapping of beneficial ownership in opaque jurisdictions.
  - **Commercial:** The projection of 150 Tier-1 banks in Year 1 is hyper-aggressive given the 12-18 month enterprise sales cycles in banking. Recommend a pivot to a "High-Frequency API" usage model or partnering with existing compliance platforms (Refinitiv, LexisNexis) for rapid distribution.

  **Risks:** 
  - **State-Level Retaliation:** The risk of DDoS or targeted cyber-warfare from sanctioned actors is correctly identified and remains the primary existential threat to the service. Infrastructure must be hardened and geographically distributed.
  - **Legal/Sovereign Interference:** Some jurisdictions may classify "true ownership discovery" as an act of espionage or a violation of local secrecy laws.

  **Recommendation:** 
  Proceed to User Stories. Focus the first milestone on a "Dark Fleet Detection MVB" (Minimum Viable Bot) using AIS-discrepancy analysis as the hook for initial banking trials.
