summary: >-
  Practical and realistic anomaly-detection EPIC for telecom infrastructure with clear loss-prevention economics,
  strong feasibility, and manageable legal profile with proper evidence workflows.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Targets a costly, under-digitized operational leak in tower operations."
    - "Good data-fusion problem with clear autonomous monitoring architecture."
    - "Value proposition is concrete: theft detection and billing anomaly reduction."
  weaknesses:
    - "Actionability depends on evidentiary quality acceptable to operations/legal teams."
    - "Sensor tampering and spoofing can reduce confidence in automated findings."
    - "May require organizational change to close loop from detection to enforcement."
  risks:
    - "Technical: adversarial spoofing may create false negatives without tamper-aware models."
    - "Market: operators may require conservative rollouts before automating interventions."
    - "Legal: evidence handling standards must support recovery/prosecution workflows."
  recommendations:
    - "Design a chain-of-evidence layer and forensic audit export in v1."
    - "Combine anomaly scores with confidence classes to support graded responses."
    - "Pilot on high-loss regions first to prove rapid payback."
