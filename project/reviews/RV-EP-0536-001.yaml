summary: >-
  EP-0536 has strong strategic vision and clear economic logic, but in current form it is not realistic
  for a zero-stage startup to launch in <=3 months with minimal sales involvement. It depends on
  complex sovereign procurement, high-trust escrow capital, and mission-critical verification/liability controls.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - Targets a high-capital, globally visible problem with clear willingness-to-pay.
    - Platform clearing-fee model can scale if liquidity and trust are established.
    - Data-driven verification concept aligns with autonomous orchestration.
  weaknesses:
    - Customer acquisition requires long-cycle government/telco contracting, conflicting with low-sales preference.
    - First-year bounty volume assumptions are aggressive for a new marketplace without anchor participants.
    - Liability, adjudication, and dispute resolution architecture are underspecified for mission-critical payouts.
  risks:
    - "Execution: procurement and capital commitments from sovereign or regulated entities may take 12-24 months."
    - "Technical: independent de-orbit verification from public radar feeds may be insufficient for automated settlement."
    - "Legal: cross-border space law, sanctions, and liability allocation can block autonomous clearing without manual governance."
  recommendations:
    - Pivot MVP to a software-only orbital risk intelligence and bounty design API sold to insurers, operators, and brokers first.
    - "Stage rollout: analytics -> simulation-backed pricing -> semi-automated clearing, instead of full instant settlement at launch."
    - Add explicit governance layer for disputes and verification confidence thresholds before payout authorization.
    - Rebase financial model to achievable pilot milestones with 2-3 anchor customers and measurable ARR targets.
