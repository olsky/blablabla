  **Pros:** Clear market need as EV adoption climbs. High user acquisition projection (15M).
  **Cons:** The concept is borderline banal. Major map providers (Google/Apple) are integrating these features. 
  **WOW Factor:** Currently low. To hit $100M+, it needs a unique "Hardware-level" or "Grid-aware" differentiator that general-purpose maps lack.
  **Recommendation:** Strengthen the 'Predictive Demand' integration to differentiate from simple reservation tools.
