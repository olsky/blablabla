  **Pros:** Essential infrastructure for the charging network scaleup. Performance-based contracts provide clear alignment with operator interests.
  **WOW Factor:** Moving maintenance from reactive to predictive for a physical network is a high-value play.
  **Risk:** False positives could lead to unnecessary truck rolls, cutting into margins. Requires high-fidelity sensor data.
  **Verdict:** Strong B2B workhorse.
