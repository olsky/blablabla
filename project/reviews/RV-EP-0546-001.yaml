summary: >-
  EP-0546 is a strong software-native marketplace concept with clear creator pain relief and good automation fit.
  It is directionally viable within 3 months for an MVP, but current business assumptions overstate first-year scale
  and understate rights-supply acquisition and licensing-enforcement complexity.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Clear, painful workflow solved: sync licensing is slow and fragmented."
    - "Software-only value path is credible: recommendation, pricing, contract generation, and payout automation."
    - "Strong adoption surface via creator platforms and editing tools."
  weaknesses:
    - Supply-side onboarding is the core bottleneck; without deep catalog depth, demand conversion drops.
    - Revenue model assumes very high transaction volume early without proven distribution channels.
    - Dynamic license terms tied to predicted reach need robust post-release reconciliation logic.
  risks:
    - "Market: two-sided marketplace cold start (catalog quality vs buyer demand) can stall growth."
    - "Legal: chain-of-title and regional rights exceptions can invalidate automated clearance if metadata is incomplete."
    - "Operational: underpricing viral outcomes can create disputes with artists and rights holders."
  recommendations:
    - Start with a narrow vertical (e.g., YouTube creators under defined budget bands) and pre-cleared contract templates.
    - Integrate with 2-3 catalog partners first, emphasizing verified chain-of-title metadata before scale.
    - Add automated post-publication reach reconciliation and true-up billing rules in v1.
    - Rebase year-one projections to milestone-driven GMV and conversion assumptions tied to distribution partnerships.
