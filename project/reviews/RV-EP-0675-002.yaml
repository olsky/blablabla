summary: >-
  Highly viable but borders on banal Web2 infrastructure. Requires an aggressive pivot towards autonomous API negotiation and non-custodial routing to hit true killer-app status.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Addresses a real, quantifiable multi-billion dollar merchant pain point."
    - "Revenue projections are realistic for the total addressable market."
    - "Conceptually sound algorithmic optimization."
  weaknesses:
    - "Current rule-based routing is not a unique moat; existing platforms (Primer, Gr4vy) do this."
    - "Custodial handling of payment data requires PCI DSS Level 1, which guarantees failure for a 2-month solo startup."
  risks:
    - "Technical: Regulatory compliance overhead regarding raw payment tokens."
    - "Market: Entering a saturated Web2 orchestration market without a radical differentiator."
  recommendations:
    - "Pivot to Autonomous Extortion/Negotiation: The AI must hold volume hostage via API to force PSPs into lower interchange rates in real-time."
    - "Pivot to Non-Custodial: Act as a routing oracle that directs the merchant's existing PCI vault, removing all regulatory liability from the startup."
