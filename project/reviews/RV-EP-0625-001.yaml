summary: >-
  High-value evidence-automation EPIC with strong real-world fit in wholesale dispute operations,
  and realistic near-term deployment if timestamp-normalization and venue-specific standards are handled early.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Addresses expensive, recurring dispute workflows with clear time-to-cash impact."
    - "Evidence assembly is a strong software-only automation use case."
    - "Good defensibility through proprietary event-correlation pipelines."
  weaknesses:
    - "Cross-system time alignment complexity can erode confidence in causal narratives."
    - "Standards fragmentation across counterparties increases customization burden."
    - "Requires strong legal-format interoperability to maximize acceptance."
  risks:
    - "Technical: correlation errors from timestamp drift can weaken evidence quality."
    - "Market: counterparties may challenge non-standardized machine-generated dossiers."
    - "Legal: admissibility and arbitration requirements vary by forum."
  recommendations:
    - "Include clock-skew correction and uncertainty metadata in evidence timelines."
    - "Ship template packs mapped to major arbitration and settlement venues."
    - "Prioritize integrations where dispute volume and average claim size are highest."
