summary: >-
  One of the strongest in the catalog: clear margin-maximization value, short ROI cycle,
  and high feasibility for autonomous deployment in payment operations.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Direct profit lever: routing optimization across acceptance/fees/fraud."
    - "Excellent enterprise ROI narrative with measurable incremental margin."
    - "Software-only and API-native implementation aligns with rapid build constraints."
  weaknesses:
    - "Control is bounded by PSP terms and opaque downstream behavior."
    - "Feedback loops can cause routing oscillations if not stabilized."
    - "Requires robust observability for finance teams to trust automation."
  risks:
    - "Technical: online-learning instability can degrade acceptance performance."
    - "Market: PSP partner constraints may reduce optimization ceiling."
    - "Legal: PCI/data-handling obligations must be rigorously enforced."
  recommendations:
    - "Use policy-constrained bandit strategies with hard guardrails on degradation."
    - "Ship finance-facing explainability dashboards and rollback controls."
    - "Anchor go-to-market on merchants with multi-PSP complexity and clear pain."
