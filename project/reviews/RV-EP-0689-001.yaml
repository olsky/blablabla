  **Pros:** Extremely high value in the FinTech space. Settlement reversal fraud is a massive, quantifiable pain point for high-volume processors.
  **WOW Factor:** The 'Firewall' approach (preemptive) rather than reactive recovery is a major selling point.
  **ROI:** Solid projections. $172M revenue with only 58k institutional users indicates high ARPU and B2B stickiness.
  **Feasibility:** High, provided access to behavioral/network metadata is maintained via banking partnerships.
