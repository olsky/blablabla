  Highly feasible compliance-monitoring EPIC with defensible enterprise value and low implementation risk,
  though adoption urgency may require sharper penalty-avoidance positioning.
analysis:

    - "Compliance automation is sticky and operationally critical in telecom workflows."
    - "Technically straightforward with rule ingestion and anomaly monitoring patterns."
    - "Strong ROI framing through avoided penalties and misroute losses."
  weaknesses:
    - "Value may be viewed as preventive rather than growth-oriented, slowing prioritization."
    - "Frequent regulatory changes create maintenance overhead."
    - "Limited viral growth dynamic compared to transaction products."
  risks:
    - "Technical: rule freshness gaps can create false assurance risk."
    - "Market: teams may delay purchase until after painful incidents."
    - "Legal: non-compliance consequences can be severe if monitor is trusted but stale."
  recommendations:
    - "Package with continuous regulatory update SLAs and alert confidence scoring."
    - "Lead with case studies quantifying avoided penalties and outage prevention."
