summary: >-
  Strong and realistic claim-automation EPIC with high operational value and feasible short-cycle delivery,
  especially where evidence provenance and chain-of-custody controls are explicit.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Clear value: faster, higher-quality insurance claim packet generation."
    - "Software-only implementation is credible with existing sensor and event data."
    - "Guardrails already align with legal evidentiary expectations."
  weaknesses:
    - "Normalization burden grows with heterogeneous data sources and carriers."
    - "Insurer acceptance may vary by line of business and jurisdiction."
    - "Initial onboarding may require template adaptation per claims workflow."
  risks:
    - "Technical: inconsistent data formats can reduce packet reliability."
    - "Market: slower insurer process change may delay realized value."
    - "Legal: venue-specific admissibility rules can require custom evidence framing."
  recommendations:
    - "Build standards adapters for top insurer packet formats first."
    - "Expose immutable provenance graph in every generated dossier."
    - "Prioritize cargo lanes with high claim frequency for rapid pilot proof."
