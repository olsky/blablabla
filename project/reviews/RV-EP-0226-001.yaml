summary: >-
  Compelling logistics optimization EPIC with strong ROI narrative and feasible autonomy progression,
  provided contractual carriage constraints are encoded into booking decisions.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Directly tackles congestion-driven penalty and working-capital losses."
    - "Rebooking optimization can deliver measurable savings quickly."
    - "Configurable autonomy levels improve practical adoption."
  weaknesses:
    - "Carrier and terminal event latency can degrade decision timing."
    - "Operational teams may resist full booking autonomy initially."
    - "Contract constraint variability can increase rule maintenance overhead."
  risks:
    - "Technical: stale event feeds can trigger suboptimal rebooking actions."
    - "Market: human override frequency may suppress early automation gains."
    - "Legal: unilateral changes may conflict with carriage terms if policy checks are weak."
  recommendations:
    - "Start with recommendation mode and escalate to auto-rebook by confidence level."
    - "Embed contract-aware policy engine with hard no-violation guards."
    - "Track avoided penalties and transit reliability as primary pilot KPIs."
