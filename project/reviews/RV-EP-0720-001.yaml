  **Pros:** High-tier sophistication. Addresses the 'Grid Overload' problem which is a existential threat to EV adoption.
  **WOW Factor:** Dynamic redistribution + Premium pricing for peak-access. It turns a utility problem into a high-margin arbitrage market.
  **Revenue:** $150M projection is realistic given the scale of utility and charging network budgets.
  **Recommendation:** Ensure the dynamic pricing engine is legally compliant with local energy utility regulations.
