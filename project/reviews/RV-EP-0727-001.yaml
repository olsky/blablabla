  **Pros:** Focus on the 'Personalized Experience' differentiates it from generic mapping tools. High user growth potential.
  **WOW Factor:** Data insights sales to automakers is a smart secondary revenue stream.
  **Cons:** Relies heavily on vehicle APIs which can be restrictive or expensive (e.g. Ford Pro, Tesla API).
  **Recommendation:** Explore decentralized or edge-computing approaches to handle the 'Driving Habits' data to minimize privacy pushback.
