  and strong path to enterprise subscriptions in EV payment ecosystems.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Security/fraud prevention is a budget-protected category with clear urgency."
    - "Strong software-only architecture and fast pilotability."
    - "Value can be quantified directly in prevented loss and chargeback reduction."
  weaknesses:
    - "Model quality depends on transaction-scale diversity and high-quality labels."
    - "False positives can degrade user experience and merchant acceptance."
    - "Initial integration with payment processors can slow first deployments."
  risks:
    - "Technical: adversarial behavior evolves rapidly and demands continuous retraining."
    - "Market: buyer trust requires demonstrated precision/recall under production traffic."
