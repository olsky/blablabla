summary: >-
  Highly compelling anti-fraud EPIC with clear demand and defensible value; realism is strong if false-positive
  control and evidentiary due-process features are treated as first-class requirements.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Large economic pain and high urgency in synthetic traffic suppression."
    - "Strong fit for autonomous detection and enforcement workflows."
    - "Revenue model is supported by loss-prevention economics."
  weaknesses:
    - "Adversarial adaptation requires continuous model hardening and fast response loops."
    - "False positives can damage partner relationships quickly."
    - "Cross-channel signal fusion quality can vary by integration depth."
  risks:
    - "Technical: attacker behavior evolves faster than static detection rules."
    - "Market: trust depends on transparent precision/recall and appeal workflows."
    - "Legal: enforcement actions need auditable evidence and procedural fairness."
  recommendations:
    - "Implement layered detection with confidence-based intervention levels."
    - "Publish quality metrics and maintain reversible enforcement actions."
    - "Prioritize segments with high fraud density for rapid ROI demonstration."
