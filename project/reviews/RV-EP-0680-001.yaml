summary: >-
  Strong B2B operations EPIC with clear financial upside and feasible autonomous resolution boundaries,
  provided contractual procedure constraints are encoded explicitly.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Targets a recurring, costly back-office bottleneck with measurable cycle-time savings."
    - "Evidence-backed autoresolution can reduce manual dispute overhead significantly."
    - "Good software-only fit with enterprise integration potential."
  weaknesses:
    - "Outcome trust depends on evidence completeness and explainability."
    - "Contract-specific dispute workflows can reduce standardization."
    - "Autonomy boundaries need strict policy controls per customer."
  risks:
    - "Technical: inconsistent evidence quality may degrade resolution accuracy."
    - "Market: customers may resist full automation for high-value disputes."
    - "Legal: deviations from contractual dispute procedure can void outcomes."
  recommendations:
    - "Automate low-risk classes first and preserve human escalation for edge cases."
    - "Maintain contractual rule packs per customer with versioned audit trails."
    - "Track win-rate and cycle-time deltas by dispute type to prove value."
