summary: >-
  EP-0509 is conceptually strong but currently not review-safe as a single EPIC because the file appears to
  contain two different concepts merged together, creating ambiguity in scope, business case, and feasibility claims.
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Both embedded concepts target large enterprise pain with data-native automation potential."
    - "Sustainability/compliance angle can unlock high willingness-to-pay."
    - "API-first integration thesis is generally sound."
  weaknesses:
    - "File integrity issue: duplicate id/title blocks with conflicting concept definitions."
    - "Scope is too broad and mixes unrelated value chains in one EPIC artifact."
    - "Current projections are not reliably attributable to one coherent product."
  risks:
    - "Execution: roadmap ambiguity can fragment engineering and go-to-market focus."
    - "Market: unclear positioning reduces buyer trust and sales clarity."
    - "Legal: compliance obligations differ sharply across the merged concepts."
  recommendations:
    - "Split into two separate EPICs with distinct IDs, business cases, and risk models."
    - "Rebaseline feasibility and ROI per isolated concept before implementation planning."
    - "Re-run schema/integrity checks after file normalization."
